# c64m - A Commodore 64 emulator written by Codex, Claude Code and Grok, produced by Stefan Wessels, 2026

c64m is a Commodore 64 emulator with PAL and NTSC video support. It runs BASIC programs,
`PRG` and `T64` files, `D64`/`G64` disk images, and `CRT` cartridges; can save and
restore full machine snapshots (`.c64state`); and includes a debugger and assembler for
C64 development.

c64m requires C64 ROM files. Place `basic`, `kernal` (or a single `system` file which
combines both `basic` and `kernal`) and `character` ROM files where discovery can find
them: the current directory, `rom/` or `roms/` under it, beside the executable (or in
`rom`/`roms` next to the binary or its parent folder), or under the INI file's
directory. A `1541` ROM (16 KB) is optional and enables the emulated 1541 drive. Files
are matched by stem name and size; extensions are ignored. JiffyDOS replacement ROMs can
be used in place of the stock `kernal` and `1541` images - they are the same sizes - but
because their filenames do not match the stems above, point at them explicitly with
`[roms] kernal=` and `[roms] 1541=` (or the Configure > Paths ROM fields).

## Overview

### Running c64m

Launch c64m from the command line or as a GUI application. Use `--help` or `-h` for the
full command-line reference.

Useful flags:

| Flag                   | Effect                                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--help` / `-h`        | Show command-line help                              |
| `--version` / `-V`     | Print version and exit                              |
| `--inifile <file>`     | Load a specific INI file at startup                 |
| `--noini` / `-n`       | Skip INI file loading entirely                      |
| `--nosaveini`          | Disable INI save on quit, regardless of other flags |
| `--saveini` / `-v`     | Save INI on quit (one-time override)                |
| `--remember` / `-r`    | Force save-on-quit into the INI file                |
| `--log-level <level>`  | Host log policy: `all`, `warn` (default), `error`, or `none` |
| `--control-port N`     | Listen on localhost TCP for C64M/8 remote control (`0`=off) |
| `--headless`           | No window; requires `--control-port`                |
| `--disk <drive>=<image[,image...]>` | Mount a D64/G64 image at startup, e.g. `--disk 8=game.d64`; comma-separated to pre-load a queue. Empty path (`--disk 8=`) soft-powers that unit without media |
| `--prg <file>` / `-p`  | Load a file as PRG at startup                       |
| `--basic <file>` / `-B`| Load a file as BASIC program at startup             |
| `--crt <file>`         | Attach a CRT cartridge at startup (types 0, 5, 19)  |
| `--sna <file>`         | Load a machine snapshot (`.c64state`) at startup    |
| `--autorun` / `-a`     | Run automatically after load (combine with `--prg`, `--basic`, or `--disk`) |
| `--inspector` / `--no-inspector` | Enable Inspector recording (checkpoints; default off). `--inspector-memory=<MiB>` sets the budget (0 or 16..4096) |
| `--history-off-on-max` / `--no-history-off-on-max` | Pause the CPU flight recorder (HST1) on max (default on). Keeps retained records; resumes on leave max |
| `--inspector-off-on-max` / `--no-inspector-off-on-max` | Wipe Inspector Record on max (default on). Does not pause the CPU flight recorder |
| `--video PAL|NTSC`, `-P`, `-N` | Override the configured video standard for this run |
| `--kbdjoy <0|1|2>`     | Drive the keyboard joystick on the given C64 port (`0` disables) |
| `--kbdjoy-layout <numpad|wasd>` | Select the keyboard joystick key layout        |
| `--turbo <list>` / `-t`| Turbo mode list for Opt+T, e.g. `1,max` (1=normal, 2/`max`=max; `3` rejected) |
| `--audio-smoke`        | Emit a 440 Hz test tone to verify audio output      |

By default, c64m loads `c64m.ini` from the current directory. The INI file stores
configuration, window size, debugger layout, and breakpoints.

### Video Standards

Select PAL or NTSC in Configure or in the `[Video]` INI section. PAL uses 6569 timing
(approximately 50 Hz); NTSC uses 6567 timing (approximately 60 Hz). Changing the video
standard reboots the emulated machine. If it was running, it resumes after the reboot;
if it was paused, it remains paused. For a one-run override, use `--video PAL`,
`--video NTSC`, `-P`, or `-N`. The command-line choice overrides the INI setting.

### Disk Images

c64m supports D64 and G64 images on devices 8 and 9. Images mount read-only by default.
`LOAD "NAME",8`, `LOAD "NAME",8,1`, wildcard loads, and `LOAD "$",8` work through a
compatibility KERNAL trap by default for D64. When a D64 is marked writable,
`SAVE "NAME",8` writes a PRG into the mounted image and flushes the host `.d64` file.
If a 1541 ROM is available and `[disk] emulate_1541=1` is set, standard disk loads for
devices 8 and 9 use the C64 KERNAL IEC routines and the emulated 1541 DOS ROM. Units are
soft-powered (stepped and on the IEC bus) only after a mount, UI device button, empty
`--disk N=`, or control `power-drive`. Plain eject leaves power on; power-off (green LED
or `power-drive N off`) ejects media and powers the unit off.

G64 needs `[disk] media_1541=1` (and `emulate_1541`) for the rotating GCR path. Mark a
G64 writable to allow physical DOS writes (BASIC `SAVE`, sequential writes, and similar
ROM paths); dirty tracks are written back to the host `.g64` on unmount and related
flush points. There is no KERNAL-trap SAVE into G64 without media.

### PRG and BASIC Files

`--prg <file>` or `-p` loads a file as a PRG at startup. The machine resets, boots
through KERNAL and BASIC, then injects the file at the load address in its first two
bytes. Execution continues automatically.

`--basic <file>` or `-B` loads a file as a BASIC program at startup. The machine resets,
boots to BASIC, writes the file to RAM at the address in its two-byte header, and
updates the BASIC start and end pointers (`$2B-$2E`).

For both options, the flag determines how the file is treated; the filename extension
does not matter.

### Machine Snapshots

`--sna <file>` loads a machine snapshot (`.c64state`) at startup. Disks from `--disk`
are mounted first; then the snapshot is restored after the runtime is running. When
`--sna` is present it takes priority over `--crt`, `--prg`, and `--basic` (those
loaders are not also applied). The snapshot must match the currently loaded ROMs.

You can also restore or write snapshots while the emulator is running:

- UI: Debugger / controls **[Load]** and **[Save]** (see **State**)
- Drag and drop a `.c64state` file onto the window
- Quickload / quicksave: **Shift+Opt+<** / **Shift+Opt+>**
- Control port: `load-state <path>` and `save-state <path>` (async; wait for
  `load-state-complete` or `save-state-complete` - see **Remote**)

Example:

```sh
./c64m --sna demos/midload.c64state
./c64m --headless --control-port 6510 --sna demos/midload.c64state
```

### Cartridges

c64m supports these `.crt` hardware types:

- **Type 0 (Normal):** generic 8K and 16K cartridges. ROML maps at `$8000-$9FFF` and, for
  16K cartridges, ROMH at `$A000-$BFFF`.
- **Type 5 (Ocean type 1):** multi-bank game cartridges. Banks are selected by writing
  to `$DE00` (bit 7 ignored). Mode is by size (VICE): non-512K images use 16K game
  (same bank at `$8000` and `$A000`); 512K images use 8K. Cart ROM follows the PLA
  (ROML needs LORAM+HIRAM; ROMH needs HIRAM) so loaders can depack into underlay RAM.
- **Type 19 (Magic Desk / Domark / HES):** multi-bank 8K cartridges. ROML maps at
  `$8000-$9FFF`; the game selects banks by writing to `$DE00`. Bit 7 of that register
  can disable the cartridge so RAM appears at `$8000` instead.

`--crt <file>` attaches a supported cartridge at startup and resets with it running; a
`.crt` file can also be dragged onto the window at any time. Unsupported cartridge types
are rejected with an error rather than attached.

Loading a program (drag a `.prg`/`.t64`/`.bas`, or use `--prg`/`--basic`) detaches an
attached cartridge first, so the program boots to BASIC instead of the cartridge. To go
from a running cartridge to BASIC without loading a program - for example to reach a disk
you have mounted - use **[Reset]** and leave **Unmount cartridge on reset** checked (see
**Emulator Controls**). Because mounting a disk does not reset the machine, mounting a disk
while a cartridge is running only becomes reachable after such a reset.

### Auto Run

`--autorun` or `-a` can be combined with `--prg`, `--basic`, or `--disk` to start
execution without any manual key press.

**With `--prg` or `--basic`:** after the file bytes are placed in memory at the BASIC
warm-start point (`$E38B`), `RUN` followed by Return is injected directly into the
KERNAL keyboard buffer. The machine begins executing the program immediately.

**With `--disk 8=<image>`:** c64m uses a two-phase relay on the BASIC main-loop address:

1. On the first BASIC `READY` prompt after boot, `LOAD"*",8` and Return are injected
   into the keyboard buffer. The KERNAL loads the first PRG file from the disk image.
2. On the next `READY` prompt (after the load finishes), `RUN` and Return are injected.
   The loaded program starts.

Both paths write PETSCII characters directly into the KERNAL keyboard buffer
(`$0277-$0280`), so they work with any BASIC or KERNAL-based program. Games or demos
that bypass the KERNAL keyboard handler entirely will not receive the injected text.

`--autorun` alone, without a loader flag, has no effect.

### Drag and Drop

Files can be dragged onto the c64m window while the emulator is running.
The file extension determines how the file is handled:

| Extension | Action                                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.d64`    | Mount the image on device 8 (replaces any previously mounted disk) |
| `.g64`    | Mount the G64 image on device 8 (same as D64; use media path for GCR) |
| `.c64state` | Load a saved machine state snapshot                         |
| `.crt`    | Attach a supported CRT (types 0, 5, 19) and reset with it running |
| `.bas`    | Load as a BASIC program (reset, boot to BASIC, inject, update `$2B-$2E`) |
| `.t64`    | Extract the first loadable T64 entry and load it like a PRG |
| anything else | Load as a PRG (reset, boot to BASIC, inject at embedded load address, auto-run) |

Extension matching is case-insensitive (`.D64` and `.d64` are treated identically).
Unlike the `--prg` and `--basic` startup flags, the extension drives the decision when
dropping - there is no way to override it by name alone.

Dropping a program (`.prg`, `.t64`, or `.bas`) while a cartridge is attached automatically
detaches the cartridge, so the dropped program boots instead of the cartridge. Dropping
another `.crt` replaces the current cartridge. See **Cartridges**.

Dropping a `.c64state` file restores the saved machine state. The snapshot must match
the currently loaded ROMs.

### Audio

SID audio uses a MOS 6581 register model at `$D400-$D41F` with three voices, ADSR
envelopes, a Chamberlin state-variable filter, and voice 3 read-back. Audio output uses
a 48 kHz stereo path through SDL. Turbo mode mutes audio to prevent buffer overflow; SID
state continues to advance normally.

## Interface

### Display

When launched, c64m shows the C64 display filling the window. Regular keys are forwarded
to the emulated C64. The window can be resized; the display always scales to fit the
available area. Whether it keeps the true CRT shape while doing so, or simply stretches
to fill, is the **True Aspect Ratio** setting. See **Display and Scaling**.

Press **F9** to open or close Debug Mode. Press **Opt+H** to open or close the in-emulator
help. Press **Opt+R** to open or close **Forensics** (CPU flight recorder FIND UI; see
**Forensics**). On macOS, **Cmd+Q** quits.

### Window Title

The OS window title shows the video standard, active turbo mode, and runtime state,
even when Debug Mode is closed and no other indicator is visible:

| Title                                  | Meaning                                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `c64m - PAL - Normal - Running`        | PAL video, normal (real-time) speed, executing normally. |
| `c64m - NTSC - Max - Paused (reason)`  | NTSC video in max free-run; execution has stopped. `reason` is one of `breakpoint`, `BRK`, `step`, `reset`, `pause`, or `run complete`. |
| `c64m - NTSC - Normal - Error`         | The runtime hit an error and stopped.        |
| `c64m - PAL - Normal - Inspect`        | Inspector mode: the C64 is a reconstructed past point. |

This lets you tell whether the emulator is paused or running without opening the debugger.

### Debug Mode

In Debug Mode, the window is divided into four main areas:

| Area          | Contents                                                    |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upper left    | C64 display (scaled to fit its region)                      |
| Upper right   | CPU register view                                           |
| Right, below  | Disassembly view                                            |
| Lower left    | Memory view                                                 |
| Lower right   | Misc panel (Machine, Debugger, Breakpoints, Hardware, Assembler, Inspector tabs) |

c64m tracks an active view for keyboard input. When no modal dialog is open, the active
C64 display, Disassembly, Misc, or Memory view has a neutral gray outline. Click a view
to make it active, or press **Opt+Tab** to cycle C64->Disassembly->Misc->Memory. Press
**Shift+Opt+Tab** to cycle in reverse. Modal dialogs keep input to themselves, so these
view-cycling keys do not work while a dialog is open.

### Layout

Two splitters divide the debug layout:

- A **vertical splitter** between the C64 display region and the CPU/Disassembly pane.
- A **horizontal splitter** between the upper and lower halves.

Drag the splitters to resize the panes. A **corner handle** at the bottom-right of the C64
display region moves both splitters together; clicking it without dragging snaps the
display region to the C64's true aspect (see **Display and Scaling**). The window size and
splitter positions are saved to the INI file on quit.

### Inspector

Inspector is time travel inside Debug Mode (F9). It is not a second debugger. Host **F7**
is not bound to Inspector; open the **Inspector** tab in Misc.

Recording is off by default. Enable it with `--inspector` (and optional
`--inspector-memory=<MiB>`) or the **Record** checkbox on that tab. Recording stores
checkpoints and stills. It does not arm the CPU flight recorder.

With Record on, **Inspect** enters Inspector at the live (paused NOW) end. Leave Inspector
restores that NOW and stays paused; it does not resume.

While Inspecting, window titles use **Inspect** and pane headers turn cobalt. Memory and
registers are read-only. The Breakpoints tab is the same live list.

The slider is **oldest retained checkpoint -> live**. Drag is preview only: the C64 does
not move. The CRT shows that cell's stored still when the Record join finds one,
otherwise a loud pink fill of the CRT area (`RGB 255,0,255`) while the thumb is down
(no reconstruct while dragging). Releasing the thumb **lands** (loads the checkpoint at
or before that time, or live at the right end); the slider snaps to the landed cycle.
After land the CRT uses the cell's still when present, otherwise paints from the landed
C64 (no pink watermark). `[-]` / `[+]` step one retained checkpoint (past the newest,
`[+]` restores live). F10 / F11 / Shift+F10 / F12 / Shift+F12 re-execute on that C64 and
stop at a breakpoint or live; they stay in Inspector. F12 does not resume the live line.
Opt+Left is unbound. Opt+B still toggles the same breakpoint list.

A successful guest disk write **drops earlier Inspector history**. The tab shows
`disk write, device N @ cycle X` at the left edge of the remaining window.

**Opt+T** into max (turbo 2 / `max`) pauses the CPU flight recorder by default
and discards Inspector Record. HST1 keeps retained records and resumes when
leaving max (back to turbo 1). Opt out of the HST1 pause with
`--no-history-off-on-max` or `[debug] history_off_on_max=false`. Separately,
Inspector Record is wiped and turns off; leaving max restores Record into a
new empty window if it was on. Record that was already off stays off. While
in max the Record checkbox is locked off. Turbo 1 still records. Opt out of
the Record wipe with `--no-inspector-off-on-max` or
`[debug] inspector_off_on_max=false`. Inspector Record still does not arm or
stop HST1.

**Forensics...** (or **Opt+R**) opens the full-window FIND UI over the CPU flight
recorder. **Land before** / **Land exact** jump Inspect to a FIND hit's cycle; they
do not drive the scrubber. A successful land then opens the debugger on the
Inspector tab. See **Forensics**.

### Turbo Mode

**Opt+T** cycles through the configured turbo mode list (default `1,max`). The
list is stored in the INI file. Value `3` is rejected on the CLI, INI, and
control port.

Turbo is two discrete modes for the whole emulated machine (CPU, VIC-II, CIAs,
SID timing, and drive sync stay in lock-step):

| Mode | Title | Behaviour |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `1` | `Normal` | Real-time pace, live ARGB framebuffer (PAL about 0.985 MHz Phi2, NTSC about 1.023 MHz). |
| `2` / `max` | `Max` | Free-run as fast as the host allows, still full live paint and collisions. |

Entering max with Inspector Record on discards that tape (see Inspector above).
Turbo 1 is unchanged.

On an Apple M2 Mac Mini, max free-runs around **12-16 MHz** emulated Phi2
(roughly **12-16x** real C64 speed) with full live paint and correctness; pure
machine-core benches land near the high end of that band, a full app free-run
somewhat lower depending on load.

### Help

Press **Opt+H** or **ESC** to open or close the in-emulator help overlay. The C64 pauses
while the overlay is open and resumes when it is dismissed.

The overlay shows one section of the manual at a time in a scrollable content area. A
navigation bar along the bottom of the overlay contains:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Prev** | Go to the previous section. Inert when already on the first section. |
| *Section name* (centre) | Shows the current section. Click to open a pop-up index of all sections; click any entry to jump directly to it. |
| **Next** | Go to the next section. Inert when already on the last section. |
| **Search:** field | Type a search term and press **Enter**, **->**, or **<-** to search. Supports regular expressions. |
| **<-** | Find the previous match, searching backward from the current match. |
| **->** | Find the next match, searching forward from the current match. |

Search is case-insensitive. When no match exists the search text turns red; it returns
to normal as soon as the term is changed. Both directions wrap around the full document.
Navigating to a new section via **Prev**, **Next**, or the index resets the search
starting point to the top of that section.

Matches are highlighted. The match you jumped to is drawn in black on a yellow band, and
every other match in the section on screen is underlined in yellow. The highlight follows
whatever is in the **Search:** field, so matches light up as you type and disappear when
the field is cleared. The view scrolls so the current match sits about a third of the way
down the content area. A match that falls across a line break is still found, but is not
highlighted.

Keyboard shortcuts active while the help overlay is open:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Left / Right** | Previous / next section |
| **PageUp / PageDown** | Scroll content up / down by one page |
| **Home** | Scroll to top of the current section |
| **End** | Scroll to bottom of the current section |
| **ESC** | Close the help overlay |

### Forensics

**Forensics** is a full-window debugger mode for searching the CPU flight
recorder (HST1 FIND / NEXT / READ). It is not the Inspector slider: FIND answers
"who wrote this?", then you can land Inspect at a hit's machine cycle.

Open from Misc -> Inspector (**Forensics...**) or **Opt+R** (works from the
full-screen CRT or with F9 Debug Mode up). Forensics and Help cannot both be
open.

| Transition | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Open Forensics | **Pauses** if the machine was running. Remembers whether you came from the CRT or the debugger. |
| **Opt+R** / **Close** | Return to that entry surface. CRT entry resumes only if it was running when Forensics opened. Debugger entry stays paused. |
| **F9** | Always open the debugger, paused (abandons any CRT resume latch). |
| Successful **Land before** / **Land exact** | Same as **F9**: debugger, paused. Also selects Misc -> Inspector. Cancel or failed land stays in Forensics. |
| **Esc** | Does **not** leave Forensics (Help still uses Esc). |

FIND requires a paused machine and retained flight-recorder records (the
recorder is on by default when `[debug] history_memory_mb` is non-zero; use
control-port `history-record` / `history-info` if you turned it off). Inspector
**Record** is separate and does not arm the flight recorder. **Clear view**
clears the transcript only; it does not call `history-clear`.

**Query line** (Enter to run). The first token must be a verb (`find`, `next`,
`read`, `info`). Bare `key=value` is not FIND (control-port `history-find` still
accepts bare keys). Up/Down browses recent queries. Tab unique-completes the next
expected token or prints that hole's syntax on the status strip. With the caret
at the end of the line, Tab unique-expands every token (`find add=$D020 acc=re`
becomes `find address=$D020 access=read`). Open values (ids, hex, ranges,
limits) are not completed.

| Input | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `find [key=value ...]` | FIND with the shared option grammar (same keys as `history-find`) |
| `next [limit=N]` | Continue the last FIND page |
| `read <id> [before=N] [after=N] [epoch=N]` | Read one retained id with context (`id` and keys may be in any order) |
| `info` | Refresh recorder status (also runs quietly when Forensics opens) |

Click a transcript line to select it (or a `---` header to select the whole
result block). **Copy** copies the full selected text. Double-click `id=`,
`cyc=`, or `pc=$...` on a record line to copy that token alone.

With a record selected:

| Button | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Land before** | Inspect land at the nearest checkpoint at or before `cyc=` (often early so you can step into the hit) |
| **Land exact** | Inspect land exactly at `cyc=` (checkpoint then re-execute to that cycle) |

If you are not yet Inspecting but checkpoints exist, either land button asks to
**Inspect & Land** first. Soft-fail if there is no Inspector window. Status
reports the post-land `focus_cycle` versus the requested cycle (clamp, live, or
quantized). After a successful land, Forensics closes and the debugger opens
paused on the Inspector tab. Cancel or a failed land leaves you in Forensics.
**Opt+R** / **Close** still return to the entry surface as above.

See **CPU Flight Recorder** under **Remote** for the wire grammar and budgets.

## CPU View

The CPU view shows the current state of the 6510 CPU as reported by the most recent
runtime snapshot:

| Field | Width | Description                      |
|-------|-------|----------------------------------|
| PC    | 16-bit | Program counter                 |
| SP    | 8-bit  | Stack pointer (page 1 offset)   |
| A     | 8-bit  | Accumulator                     |
| X     | 8-bit  | X index register                |
| Y     | 8-bit  | Y index register                |
| N V - B D I Z C | 1-bit each | Processor status flags |

When the CPU is paused, all fields are editable:

- PC: four hex digits.
- SP, A, X, Y: two hex digits.
- Flags: `0` (clear) or `1` (set).

The `-` position in the flag row represents the unused bit; it is always 1 and cannot
be modified.

## Disassembly View

The Disassembly view shows the code at and around the program counter. While running,
the current instruction (the PC line) scrolls into view. While paused, the cursor is
independent of the PC.

### Line Format

Each line follows this general format:

```
C123: LABEL        A9 00       LDA #$00
```

| Column  | Meaning                                              |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `C123`  | Hex address                                          |
| `LABEL` | Symbol name at that address (when available)         |
| `A9 00` | Raw bytes                                            |
| `LDA #$00` | Disassembled instruction with resolved symbols    |

Breakpoint addresses show an indicator in the left gutter.

### Effective Address and Value

When the emulator is paused, lines whose target address is not already obvious
from the operand gain a trailing annotation showing the resolved address and,
for memory reads and writes, the byte currently at that address:

```
C123:             B1 FB       LDA ($FB),Y   [$4050:25]
```

Here the pointer at `$FB/$FC` plus the current **Y** register resolves to
`$4050`, which currently holds `$25`. The address is computed from the current
CPU registers and the CPU-visible memory, so it reflects what the running CPU
would actually read or write.

The annotation appears for:

- indexed and indirect operands, such as `$40,X`, `$40,Y`, `screen,X`,
  `screen,Y`, `($40,X)`, and `($FB),Y`, which show `[$addr:value]`;
- `JMP ($xxxx)` indirect jumps, which show the resolved `[$addr]` target;
- direct addresses, branches, `JMP`, and `JSR` operands that are shown as a
  **label** - data references show `[$addr:value]`, branch and jump targets
  show `[$addr]`.

It is deliberately omitted where the address is already plain in the operand,
such as `LDA #$00` (immediate), `LDA $4000` (literal absolute), and
`LDA $FB` (literal zero page). Because the annotation depends on the current
register and memory snapshot, it is shown only while the machine is paused, and
it is not drawn while the emulator is running.

### Display Modes

The disassembly view has three source modes that control which bytes are read for
disassembly:

| Mode    | Mode border | Bytes shown                                              |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Map** | none        | CPU-visible address space (current bank configuration)   |
| **ROM** | amber       | Physical ROM bytes at ROM addresses, regardless of mapping; RAM elsewhere |
| **RAM** | blue        | Raw RAM at every address, regardless of any ROM overlay  |

ROM and RAM draw a colored source-mode border inside the content area. Map has no
source-mode color; if the view is active, the separate neutral active-view border is
still shown.

Switch modes with **right-click** anywhere in the view (the **Source** group lists all
three with an asterisk next to the active choice), or with **Opt+M** from the keyboard.

When the emulator is paused, the same popup also shows an **Access** group for the
address under the disassembly cursor. The four `XXXX` entries are the recorded program
counters of the last instructions that wrote to that C64 address, oldest retained entry
first and newest entry last. `0000` means no writer has been recorded for that slot.
Selecting one of the entries moves the Disassembly cursor to that address, the same kind
of jump as entering the writer PC with `Opt+A`.

### Keyboard Controls

| Key             | Action                                                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Opt+A`         | Enter address-jump mode; type four hex digits then Enter   |
| `Opt+B`         | Toggle execute breakpoint at cursor (paused only; same list while Inspecting) |
| `Opt+M`         | Cycle source mode: Map -> ROM -> RAM -> Map                |
| `Opt+S`         | Open the Symbol Lookup dialog                              |
| `Opt+Left`      | Set PC to cursor address (paused only; unbound while Inspecting) |
| `Up` / `Down`   | Move cursor one instruction                                |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll one page                                            |
| `Home` / `End`  | Jump to first or last line of the current view             |
| `Opt+Home`      | Jump to address `$0000`                                    |
| `Opt+End`       | Jump to address `$FFFF`                                    |

### Symbol Lookup

**Opt+S** opens the Symbol Lookup dialog while the Disassembly view is active.

The dialog shows a searchable, sortable table of all symbols known to the debugger,
including labels exported from the assembler and symbols loaded from external symbol
files.

**Columns:**

| Column  | Contents                                                          |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ADDR`  | Symbol address in hex (`XXXX`)                                    |
| `SCOPE` | Assembler scope path, e.g. `anon_0001` (up to 15 characters)     |
| `LABEL` | Symbol name (leaf portion, up to 15 characters)                   |
| `SOURCE`| File basename (no extension), or `assembler` for inline assembly  |

**Search:** the field at the top has focus when the dialog opens. Type to filter the
list. The pattern is matched against a combined string `"XXXX scope label source"` for
each row using simple regex syntax: `.` matches any character, `*` matches zero or more
of the previous character, `^` anchors to the start, `$` anchors to the end.

**Sorting:** clicking any column header sorts by that column ascending (`^`). Clicking
the same header again reverses to descending (`v`). The default sort is by address
ascending.

**Navigation:**

| Key / Action            | Effect                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Type in search box      | Filter rows to matching symbols                        |
| `Tab`                   | Switch keyboard focus between search box and table     |
| `Up` / `Down`           | Move the selection in the table (table focus)          |
| `Enter`                 | Commit selected row (table focus)                      |
| Click a row             | Commit that row                                        |
| Click a column header   | Sort by that column (toggle direction)                 |
| **[Close]** or `ESC`    | Dismiss without navigating                             |

**On commit:** the Disassembly view cursor jumps to the symbol's address, equivalent to
entering the address with `Opt+A`.

## Memory View

The Memory view shows the full 64 K address space as 16-byte rows in hex and ASCII.

### Line Format

```
C123: 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 21 00 00 00 00  Hello World!....
```

| Column       | Meaning                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `C123`       | Hex address of the first byte in the row   |
| `48 65 ...`   | Byte values in hex                         |
| `Hello ...`    | ASCII representation (`.` for non-print)   |

### Display Modes

The memory view has source modes that control which address space is displayed:

| Mode    | Mode border | Bytes shown                                              |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Map** | none        | C64 CPU-visible address space (current bank configuration) |
| **ROM** | amber       | Physical C64 ROM bytes at ROM addresses, regardless of mapping; RAM elsewhere |
| **RAM** | blue        | Raw C64 RAM at every address, regardless of any ROM overlay |
| **1541 Map 8** | gray | Device 8's 1541 address map, read-only                  |
| **1541 Map 9** | gray | Device 9's 1541 address map, read-only                  |

The 1541 map modes are inspection views for the selected drive. They show drive RAM at
`$0000-$07FF`, the RAM mirror at `$0800-$0FFF`, the serial VIA at `$1800-$1BFF`, the
disk-controller VIA at `$1C00-$1FFF`, and the 1541 ROM at `$C000-$FFFF` when a ROM is
loaded for that drive. Addresses outside the available 1541 map are shown as `--` in the
hex column and blank in the ASCII column.

ROM, RAM, and 1541 map modes draw a colored source-mode border inside the content area.
Map has no source-mode color; if the view is active, the separate neutral active-view
border is still shown.

Switch modes with **right-click** anywhere in the view (the **Source** group lists all
choices with an asterisk next to the active choice), or with **Opt+M** from the keyboard.

The memory and disassembly view modes are independent of each other -- for example, you
can watch raw RAM in the memory view while the disassembler follows the CPU map
simultaneously. The disassembly view remains a C64 view; selecting a 1541 map in memory
does not change the CPU register panel, stepping behavior, breakpoints, or disassembly.

### Status Row

The bottom of the Memory view shows the active edit field (`Hex`, `ASCII`, or
`Address`), the current cursor address as `Address: XXXX`, and whether memory editing
is currently `editable` or `read-only`.

### Virtual Views

The memory panel can be split into up to 16 independent virtual views stacked vertically.
Each virtual view maintains its own cursor, scroll position, source mode, and edit state.
A thin separator line marks the boundary between adjacent views.

**Splitting** inserts a new view directly below the active view. The new view inherits the
active view's source mode and starts with its cursor at the split address. Row height is
distributed proportionally among all views; each view has a minimum of one row.

**Dissolving** removes the active view and returns its rows proportionally to the remaining
views. If only one view exists, dissolving is a no-op. After dissolving, focus moves to
the view below, or to the view above if the dissolved view was the bottommost.

Each virtual view has a unique background color drawn from a 16-slot palette. Slots are
assigned in order and freed when a view is dissolved; a freed slot is reused by the next
split.

Click anywhere in a view to make it active. The mouse wheel scrolls the view under the
pointer regardless of which view is currently active.

ROM/RAM/1541 source-mode borders are drawn inside each view's own region. The neutral
active-panel selection border still wraps the entire memory panel regardless of how many
views are present.

The scrollbar on the right represents the active view's position in the 64 K space.
Switching the active view moves the thumb without scrolling the memory itself.

Right-clicking a memory view opens a popup for the view under the pointer. The
**Source** group changes that view's source mode. The **View** group can **Split** the
clicked view at the clicked address; when more than one virtual view exists it also
offers **Join** to dissolve the clicked view.

When the emulator is paused, the popup also shows an **Access** group for the clicked
address. The four `XXXX` entries are the write history for that C64 address:

```
oldest  older  newer  newest
```

Each entry is the 16-bit program counter of an instruction that wrote to the address.
For example, `0000 0000 A000 A123` means two writes have been recorded so far: first
from `$A000`, then from `$A123`. Selecting an entry moves the Disassembly cursor to that
writer PC.

### Keyboard Controls

| Key               | Action                                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Opt+A`           | Toggle address-entry mode; type four hex digits to jump      |
| `Opt+M`           | Cycle source mode: Map -> ROM -> RAM -> 1541 Map 8 -> 1541 Map 9 -> Map |
| `Opt+S`           | Open the Symbol Lookup dialog                                |
| `Opt+X`           | Toggle between hex and ASCII edit modes                      |
| `Opt+V`           | Split active view at cursor                                  |
| `Shift+Opt+V`     | Split active view at the start of the cursor row             |
| `Opt+J`           | Dissolve active view (no-op when only one view exists)       |
| `Opt+Up`          | Switch focus to the view above                               |
| `Opt+Down`        | Switch focus to the view below                               |
| `Up` / `Down`     | Move cursor one row (16 bytes)                               |
| `Left` / `Right`  | Move cursor one byte (or nibble in hex mode)                 |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn`   | Scroll one page                                              |
| `Home`            | Move cursor to start of the current row                      |
| `Opt+Home`        | Move cursor to the start of the visible window               |
| `End`             | Move cursor to end of the current row                        |
| `Opt+End`         | Move cursor to the end of the visible window                 |
| `0-9`, `A-F`     | Edit hex nibble at cursor (paused only, hex mode)            |

**Opt+S** also opens the Symbol Lookup dialog from the Memory view. On commit, the
active virtual view scrolls so that the symbol's address is row-aligned (the row
containing that address appears at the top of the view) and the cursor is placed on
the exact byte. See **Symbol Lookup** under **Disasm** for full dialog reference.

Memory editing is only possible while the CPU is paused. In hex mode, typing hex digits
overwrites the nibble at the cursor. In ASCII mode, printable characters overwrite the
byte at the cursor. The 1541 map modes are read-only; edit keystrokes are ignored there.

## Machine

The Machine tab is the first tab in the Misc panel and groups controls for disks,
programs, and emulator management.

### Disks

Devices 8 and 9 each show a row of controls followed by a disk selector:

```
[8] (LED) [Eject]  <disk name [v]>
[9] (LED) [Eject]  <disk name [v]>
```

Each device maintains an ordered queue of D64/G64 images. At most one image is mounted at a
time; the rest are queued for later use.

**Soft power.** Each unit starts **off** (not stepped, not on the IEC bus) until something
powers it on. That keeps free-run fast for PRG/CRT/BASIC and avoids an idle second drive
answering ATN. Ejecting media alone does **not** power off.

A unit turns **on** when you:

- Mount a disk (any successful mount path)
- Click **[8]** or **[9]** (opens the file browser and powers that unit even if you cancel)
- Click the **red** power LED
- Use CLI `--disk 8=` / `--disk 9=` (empty path)
- Use control-port `power-drive 8` / `power-drive 8 on`

A unit turns **off** when you:

- Click the **green** power LED (ejects any media / clears the queue, then powers off)
- Use control-port `power-drive 8 off`

**[8] / [9]** - Soft power-on for that unit, then open a file browser. Selecting an image
**replaces** the entire queue with that one disk and mounts it immediately.

**Shift+[8] / Shift+[9]** - Soft power-on, then open a file browser to **add** an image
into the queue immediately after the currently mounted disk (same as the former **[Add]**
button). If the drive is empty, the image is added and mounted.

**(LED)** - Power **switch** for that unit: **green** = powered (click to eject media and
power off), **red** = off (click to power on). Separate from the corner activity LEDs
(read/write).

**[Eject]** - Removes the currently mounted disk from the queue and mounts the next one.
If the last disk in the queue is ejected, the drive becomes empty (but stays powered). The
queue wraps round-robin: ejecting the final entry mounts the first remaining entry, not
nothing.

**[Eject!]** (hold Shift while clicking **[Eject]**) - Ejects all disks from the queue
and leaves the drive empty (still powered).

The selector to the right of the buttons shows the basename of the currently mounted
image. Clicking it opens a drop-down listing every image in the queue; selecting one
mounts it immediately and makes it current.

The queue order and current index are not saved when the emulator quits. On the next
launch the first image in the saved list is mounted.

When **Show disk LEDs** is enabled in Configure (see **Configure**), shared **activity**
indicators appear in the bottom-right corner of the application window while either
device 8 or 9 is reading or writing. The green LED is disk read activity; the red LED
is write activity. Both drives share the same pair of LEDs. They appear only during
activity and go out shortly after the transfer finishes.

### Programs

**[Load]** opens the Load dialog:

| Field           | Meaning                                                    |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name + Browse   | Select the host PRG or binary file to load                 |
| From File       | Read the two-byte load address header from the file (default on) |
| Address field   | Manual load address in hex, active when From File is off   |
| Reset           | Reset the machine and wait for BASIC (`$E38B`) before injecting |
| Basic Program   | Update TXTTAB (`$2B/$2C`) and VARTAB (`$2D/$2E`) after load |
| Basic Text      | Treat the file as ASCII BASIC listing, tokenize it, and load it at `$0801` |

Selecting a `.T64` file extracts the first loadable tape-container entry and loads it
through the PRG-style reset/inject path. The raw binary options in this dialog do not
apply to `.T64` files.

The Load dialog is keyboard-driven: **Return** (or keypad Return) performs the same
action as **[OK]** when the Name field is nonempty, including the normal address
validation. **Opt+Return** opens **Browse...**. Once the file browser is open, it is the
active dialog, so typing selects a file and **Return** opens the selected file.

**Basic Text** loads a plain-text BASIC listing - the kind you get from a `LIST`,
or an ASCII `.bas` file - rather than a tokenized PRG. c64m tokenizes the source on
the host exactly as the C64 would, writes the program to memory at `$0801`, and sets
the BASIC pointers so the result is ready to `LIST` or `RUN`. Each line must begin with
a line number, and lines are expected in ascending order. Only stock BASIC V2 keywords
are recognized; extension dialects such as Simon's BASIC are not supported. When Basic
Text is selected the From File and Address controls do not apply, and it is mutually
exclusive with Basic Program.

**[Save]** opens the Save dialog:

| Field                | Meaning                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Name + Browse        | Choose the output filename                              |
| Basic Program        | Read start and end from `$2B-$2E`; forces header on    |
| Basic Text           | Detokenize the live BASIC program and save it as an ASCII listing |
| Write address header | Prefix the saved file with the two-byte load address   |
| Start / End          | Hex address range for a raw memory save                |

**Basic Text** saves the BASIC program currently in memory as a plain-text listing,
the same text you would see from a `LIST`, instead of a tokenized PRG. The program is
read from the live BASIC pointers (`$2B-$2E`) and written with no load-address header.
As with loading, only stock BASIC V2 keywords are handled. When Basic Text is selected
the Start / End fields do not apply, and it is mutually exclusive with Basic Program.

Control codes embedded in string literals - cursor movement, colour changes, CLR/HOME,
reverse on/off, and so on - cannot be written as raw ASCII, so they are saved as named
escapes in braces and translated back to the original bytes on load. For example a
CLR/HOME character (`CHR$(147)`) is written as `{clr/home}`, HOME as `{home}`, cursor
down as `{down}`, and colour codes as `{red}`, `{blue}`, and so on. The `pi` character is
written as `{pi}`. Any byte without a name - including graphics characters - is written
as a hexadecimal escape such as `{$a0}`; a decimal form like `{147}` is also accepted on
load. Escapes are recognized anywhere in a line, so a literal `{` in the text is itself
written as `{$7b}`. Because the codes are normalized to the uppercase/graphics character
set, lowercase-mode listings and embedded graphics characters do not round-trip
literally, but their exact bytes are always preserved through the numeric escapes.

### State

**[Load]** opens a file browser for a `.c64state` snapshot and restores it.

**[Save]** opens a save dialog and writes a named `.c64state` snapshot.

State snapshots preserve the emulated machine state, RAM, color RAM, CPU, VIC-II, CIA,
SID, attached cartridge (including Magic Desk multi-bank state), mounted D64/G64
drive-slot data, and live 1541 drive-object state when real 1541 emulation is on.
Host-side extras stored with the snapshot include the keyboard joystick layout/port and
the disk path queues for devices 8 and 9 (so a multi-disk CLI queue is restored for UI
swap after load). C64 ROM bytes are referenced and hash-validated rather than fully
embedded, so a snapshot is expected to be loaded with the same ROM files available. A
failed load leaves the live machine unchanged.

**Shift+Opt+>** quicksaves to the snapshot folder (Configure -> Paths -> `snapshot`,
which defaults to the current directory). Each quicksave creates a new timestamped
`.c64state` file; existing quicksaves are not overwritten. **Shift+Opt+<** quickloads
the newest `.c64state` in that folder.

At startup, use `--sna <file>` to load a snapshot from the command line. Over the
control port, use `load-state <path>` and `save-state <path>` (see **Machine Snapshots**
and **Remote**).

### Emulator Controls

**[Configure...]** opens the Configure dialog (see **Configure**).

**[Reset]** performs a hard reset of the emulated C64 and preserves its running state:
it resumes automatically if it was running, or remains paused if it was stopped. Any
pending PRG injection or assembler-queued run is cancelled. If a cartridge is attached,
**[Reset]** first opens a prompt with an **Unmount cartridge on reset** checkbox (checked
by default): leaving it checked resets to BASIC with the cartridge removed, while
unchecking it keeps the cartridge so the reset re-runs it. When no cartridge is attached,
Reset happens immediately with no prompt.

## Debugger

The Debugger tab shows runtime counters and the call stack.

### Counters

| Counter         | Meaning                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU cycles      | Total 6510 cycles executed since last reset          |
| Machine cycles  | Master cycle counter                                 |
| VIC cycles      | VIC-II cycles advanced                               |
| CIA cycles      | CIA cycles advanced                                  |
| Frame           | Frame number, cycle within frame, dropped frames     |

### Step Counters

```
Step - CPU: 2  Machine: 2
```

The step counter line resets to zero each time a step or run command is issued (F10,
Shift+F10, F11, F12, Shift+F12) and freezes when the CPU stops. It shows how many cycles
elapsed during that operation.

Two values are shown because they can differ:

- **CPU** - cycles the 6510 actually spent executing. This is deterministic with respect
  to your code and is the right metric when profiling or counting instruction cycles.

- **Machine** - wall-clock cycles of the C64 chip: every tick of the crystal oscillator,
  including cycles where the CPU was frozen while VIC-II held the bus. This reflects real
  elapsed time on the hardware.

The difference between the two is **BA stall cycles**. When VIC-II needs the bus to fetch
sprite or bitmap data it asserts the BA (Bus Available) line low. The CPU sees RDY go low
and freezes - it has no say in the matter. Depending on sprite configuration and timing,
a stall can last 1-3 cycles or longer. Because stalls depend on what VIC-II is doing at
that exact moment, machine cycle counts can vary between otherwise identical runs. CPU
cycle counts will not.

In practice the two numbers are identical whenever no sprites are active or the measured
code does not overlap a BA window. When they differ, the gap is the VIC-II overhead, not
your code.

### Call Stack

The call stack shows the chain of active JSR calls reconstructed from the 6510 hardware
stack each frame. Entries have the form:

```
E69E | JSR FF59 OLDRST
```

| Part    | Meaning                                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `E69E`  | Address of the JSR instruction                     |
| `FF59`  | Destination address (subroutine entry)             |
| `OLDRST`| Symbol name for `$FF59`, when available            |

Clicking either address in an entry moves the Disassembly view cursor to that address.
Up to 16 entries are displayed; the list has its own scrollbar when there are more.

## Breakpoints

The Breakpoints tab lists all configured breakpoints. When no breakpoints exist, the tab
is empty. A **[Clear All]** button appears at the top when more than one breakpoint is
present.

### Breakpoint Types

| Type    | Trigger condition                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Execute | CPU fetches an instruction at the address                |
| Read    | CPU reads from the address or range                      |
| Write   | CPU writes to the address or range                       |

### BRK

When **Pause on BRK** is enabled (Config -> Machine, or `[config] pause_on_brk`), a `BRK`
opcode ($00) pauses the emulator with no breakpoint needed. The CPU does not execute it;
the instruction is intercepted before the stack is touched, and the window title (see
**Window Title**) ends with `Paused (BRK)`.

This usually indicates that execution has reached uninitialized memory, passed the end of
a program, or followed a corrupted jump vector. Letting it execute can repeatedly push to
the stack and wrap the stack pointer through `$0100-$01FF`. Pausing at the first BRK lets
you inspect the failure before the stack is overwritten.

**Pause on BRK is off by default.** Some cartridges and games execute a `BRK` during
normal boot and rely on the KERNAL handler to recover (for example Ocean carts such as
Wonderboy); with the pause off they run through it like real hardware. Turn it on when you
want the crash aid described above. Either way, a single explicit step (**F11**) always
executes a BRK normally, since you asked for that exact instruction; when the pause is on,
it also applies to free-running execution (Run, Step Over, Step Out, and run-N commands).

### Breakpoint List Format

Each entry in the list shows a label and action buttons:

```
W[C123-C1FF] (5/10)  [Edit] [Disable] [Clear]
```

| Part           | Meaning                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `R`, `W`, `RW` | Access type (read, write, or either)                           |
| `[C123]`       | Address; or `[C123-C1FF]` for a range                          |
| `(5/10)`       | Counter: total hits / repeat countdown (shown when counter is active) |
| Action label   | `Fast`, `Slow`, `Tron`, `Troff`, `Swap`, `Type`, or nothing (Break) |

- **[Edit]** opens the Breakpoint Editor.
- **[Disable]** / **[Enable]** toggles the breakpoint without removing it.
- **[Clear]** deletes the breakpoint.

Breakpoints are persisted in the INI file under the `[DEBUG]` section.

### Breakpoint Editor

The editor dialog lets you set the address (or address range), access type, mapping
filter, action, and counters for a breakpoint.

**Access** options: `PC` (execute), `Address Access` (read/write).

**Mapping filter** (Map / ROM / RAM): restricts the breakpoint to fire only when the
CPU's current mapping matches. `Map` means fire regardless of mapping.

**Range**: check to enter a second address; any access in `[start, end]` triggers the
breakpoint.

**Conditions** (control port only): a breakpoint created over the control port can
carry a guard (`when=`) so it only fires under a stated circumstance, such as a write
that happens inside an IRQ handler or on a given raster line. Guards are stored in the
INI as a `when=` item and keep working across restarts, but this editor cannot show or
change them. Saving a guarded breakpoint from this dialog clears its guard, because the
dialog rebuilds the whole definition from the fields shown here. See the control port
documentation for the condition syntax.

**Actions**:

| Action  | Parameter field | Effect                                                  |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Break   | -               | Pause execution (default)                               |
| Fast    | -               | Switch to free-run (breakpoint speed mode; paint off)   |
| Slow    | -               | Restore normal paced speed                              |
| Troff   | -               | Disable per-instruction execution trace                 |
| Tron    | Filename        | Enable per-instruction execution trace; writes to the given file, or `trace.log` if the field is empty |
| Swap    | Queue step      | Navigate the device 8 disk queue (see below)            |
| Type    | Text            | Inject text as C64 keystrokes when the breakpoint fires |

Tron and Troff are mutually exclusive: checking one automatically clears the other.
When Tron, Swap, or Type is unchecked, its parameter field is grayed out.

**Swap parameter format:**

| Form  | Meaning                                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+N`  | Move forward N steps in the queue (wraps)                            |
| `-N`  | Move backward N steps in the queue (wraps)                           |
| `N`   | Mount the Nth disk in the queue, 1-based (wraps if out of range)     |
| empty | No-op (Swap flag is set but does nothing)                            |

**Counter**: enter a hit count and a repeat count. With hit count `N` and repeat count
`M`, the action fires on the Nth hit and then every Mth hit thereafter. Set repeat to
`0` to auto-disable the breakpoint after it fires once. Set both to 0 to disable
counting (the Use Counter checkbox controls this).

**Type text format:**

The Type field uses an escape-based input encoding. Literal printable characters (space
through `~`) are typed as-is; `\` introduces an escape sequence. Uppercase letters
produce SHIFT+key; lowercase produce the unshifted key. Up to 128 events per sequence.

| Form              | Meaning                                                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\[NAME]`         | Press and release named key; bare modifiers are one-shot         |
| `\[NAME+]`        | Assert (hold) named key                                          |
| `\[NAME-]`        | Deassert (release) named key                                     |
| `\[W:N]`          | Wait N normal keypress durations (`0` is a no-op)                |
| `\[WAIT:N]`       | Same as `\[W:N]`                                                 |
| `\xHH`            | PETSCII byte, two hex digits                                     |
| `\dDDD`           | PETSCII byte, three decimal digits                               |
| `\oOOO`           | PETSCII byte, three octal digits                                 |
| `\mR,C`           | Direct matrix key: row R, column C (digits 0-7)                  |
| `\jPD` / `\jPD,B` | Joystick: port P (1-2), direction D (0-8), optional button B (0-1) |

Direction codes: 0=centre, 1=up, 2=up-right, 3=right, 4=down-right, 5=down,
6=down-left, 7=left, 8=up-left.

**Named keys (case-insensitive):**

| Name       | Alias | Key           | Name        | Alias | Key          |
|------------|-------|---------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| `RETURN`   | `RT`  | Return        | `SHIFT`     | `SH`  | Shift        |
| `RESTORE`  | `RE`  | Restore (NMI) | `CBM`       | `CB`  | Commodore    |
| `RUNSTOP`  | `RS`  | Run/Stop      | `CTRL`      | `CT`  | Control      |
| `CLRHOME`  | `CH`  | Clr/Home      | `SPACE`     | `SP`  | Space        |
| `INSDEL`   | `ID`  | Ins/Del       | `POUND`     | `PO`  | POUND        |
| `CUU`      |       | Cursor up     | `LEFTARROW` | `LA`  | <-           |
| `CUD`      |       | Cursor down   | `UPARROW`   | `UA`  | ^            |
| `CUL`      |       | Cursor left   | `PI`        |       | pi           |
| `CUR`      |       | Cursor right  | `F1`-`F8`   |       | Function keys |
| `PLUS`     |       | +             | `MINUS`     |       | -            |
| `AT`       |       | @             | `ASTERISK`  | `AS`  | *            |

Characters with no C64 equivalent produce a parse error. The editor rejects the commit
and positions the cursor at the offending character; the INI loader logs the error and
skips the Type action for that breakpoint.

Examples:

```
load\[RT]               Type LOAD and press Return
\[SH+]\[F1]\[SH-]       Produce F2 (SHIFT+F1) but \[F2] would have also worked
\[CT]S                  Type Ctrl+S, then release Ctrl
\[CT]\[SH]S             Type Ctrl+Shift+S, then release both modifiers
\[CTRL+]\[CTRL]SA\[CTRL-]  Keep Ctrl held for both S and A
\x22*\x22,8,1\[RT]      "* ",8,1 then Return
\j11,1                  Joystick port 1 up with fire button
\[RS]\[RE]              RUN/STOP + RESTORE soft reset (see note below)
S\[W:2]A                Type S, wait for two normal keypress durations, then A
S\[WAIT:2]A             Same as above
```

Bare `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `CBM`, and `RUNSTOP` tokens are one-shot modifiers. They are
asserted immediately and released after the next non-modifier key or RESTORE event
completes. The short aliases are `SH`, `CT`, `CB`, and `RS`.

Explicit `+` and `-` modifier forms still hold and release keys manually.
For example, `\[CTRL+]\[CTRL]SA\[CTRL-]` keeps Ctrl held for both `S` and `A`;
the middle bare `\[CTRL]` is redundant because Ctrl is already explicitly held.

**RESTORE and the `+`/`-` modifier:** `RESTORE` is an NMI key, not a keyboard matrix key.
The `+` and `-` modifiers are silently ignored - `\[RE]`, `\[RE+]`, and `\[RE-]` all fire
the same one-shot NMI. There is no way to "hold" RESTORE.

**RUN/STOP + RESTORE soft reset:** Use `\[RS]\[RE]`.

Alias note: `RE` means RESTORE; `RS` means RUNSTOP.

**[Apply]** applies changes. **[Cancel]** discards them.

Setting an execute breakpoint from the keyboard while the cursor is in the Disassembly
view is faster: position the cursor and press **Opt+B**. A second press removes the
breakpoint.

## Hardware

The Hardware tab provides a read-only view of the emulated C64 hardware state using
data from the most recent runtime snapshot. All sections are collapsible tree views.

| Section       | Contents                                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Memory/Banks  | CPU port banking, CPU-visible regions, VIC bank, `$D018` bases |
| VIC-II        | Raster position, IRQ state, all VIC registers, color, sprite state |
| CIA #1        | Ports A/B, timers A/B, ICR, TOD, alarm                    |
| CIA #2        | Ports A/B, timers A/B, ICR, TOD, alarm, IEC line state    |
| SID           | Voice parameters, filter, read-back registers, last sample |
| Counters      | Audio overrun/underrun, VIC BA events                      |

The Hardware tab is intended for diagnostics. Clicking values here does not modify
machine state.

## Assembler

The Assembler tab provides access to the integrated two-pass 6502 assembler.

### Assembler Controls

| Field        | Meaning                                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| File Name    | Path to the root assembly source file, shown relative to the INI directory; use **Browse...** to pick |
| Assemble at  | Optional host origin. When checked, assemble with this hex default (default `$8000`). When unchecked, the source must set its own origin (`* =` / `.org`); the host supplies `$0000` as a placeholder only |
| Auto-run at  | When checked, after a successful assembly sets PC to this hex address and resumes (jumps straight into ML). Mutually exclusive with Run BASIC |
| Run BASIC (paste RUN) | When checked, after a successful assembly fixes the BASIC program pointers as a LOAD would and RUNs the program through the BASIC editor (no PC poke). Use this for a BASIC-stub program such as `10 SYS ....`. Mutually exclusive with Auto-run at |
| Reset C64       | If checked, resets the machine and waits for BASIC (`$E38B`) before assembling |
| Rearm one-shots | If checked, re-enables every auto-disabled one-shot breakpoint (`repeat = 0`) and resets its hit counter before assembling |
| **[Assemble]**  | Assembles the source and loads bytes into C64 RAM            |

When **Reset C64** is checked (the default), assembly waits for BASIC to initialize
before writing code. This is the safe path for programs that expect a clean BASIC
environment. When **Reset C64** is unchecked, the assembler writes directly into live
RAM in whatever state the machine is in. If **Auto-run at** is also set, the emulator
immediately jumps to that address and resumes execution.

**Run BASIC (paste RUN)** is the counterpart to Auto-run for programs that start
with a BASIC stub (`10 SYS ....`). Assembling is not the same as loading a PRG:
it writes bytes into RAM but does not update the BASIC text/variable pointers, so
a plain `RUN` would find no program. With this box checked, after a successful
assembly the emulator sets `TXTTAB`/`VARTAB`/`ARYTAB`/`STREND` from the emitted
image (exactly as a LOAD would) and then types `RUN` through the BASIC editor, so
the program starts the same way a human would start it - no PC poke. Because the
pasted `RUN` needs the machine at a READY prompt, leave **Reset C64** checked (the
default); the reset is skipped automatically when the machine is already sitting
at a fresh, undisturbed READY (for example right after launch), so you do not pay
for a redundant reset.

If the host supplies a default origin (Assemble at checked, or the control-port
`address=` default) and the source has not yet emitted any bytes, a later `* = $nnnn`
or `.org $nnnn` re-anchors the segment to that address with no error. Going backwards
after code has been emitted is still an error.

**Rearm one-shots** is useful during iterative development: set a breakpoint with
`repeat = 0` so it fires exactly once, then check this box so each re-assemble brings
it back to life without manual re-enabling.

Assembler labels are exported to the debugger symbol table immediately after a
successful assembly, and appear in the Disassembly view.

If assembly fails, a scrollable error dialog shows each error with its source file and
line number.

### Assembler INI persistence

The following assembler settings are saved in the `[assembler]` section of the INI
file and restored on next launch. All keys are optional.

```
[assembler]
file           = path/to/source.asm   ; path to source file (relative to INI or absolute)
address        = 8000                 ; hex load/assembly origin address
use_address    = yes                  ; apply address as host origin (default: yes)
run_address    = 8000                 ; hex auto-run address
auto_run       = no                   ; jump to run address after assembly (default: no)
basic_run      = no                   ; fix BASIC pointers and paste RUN after assembly (default: no)
reset          = yes                  ; Reset C64 before assembling (default: yes)
rearm_oneshots = no                   ; Rearm one-shot breakpoints before assembling (default: no)
auto_adjust_segments = no             ; Retry overlapping segment layouts (default: no)
```

When `auto_adjust_segments` is enabled, an overlap detected during pass 1 causes up
to three fresh layout retries using the assembler's suggested starts. Pass 2 only
runs after the layout no longer overlaps. The source file is not changed; after a
successful adjusted assembly, an **Assembly Adjustments** dialog lists the `.segdef`
addresses to copy back into the source.

### Assembler Language

The assembler supports standard 6502 mnemonics and addressing modes. C64 programs
target the 6510, which is instruction-compatible with the 6502.

**Comments:** `;` begins a comment; everything after it on the line is ignored.

**Labels:** start with a letter or `_`, may contain letters, digits, and `_`, and end
with `:`.

**Variables:** assigned with `ident = expr`. Postfix `++` and `--` modify the variable
as a prefix operation: `lda #i++` loads the value after increment.

**Current address:** `*` reads the current output address - the address of the
instruction or line being assembled, following the standard assembler convention. For
example `jmp *` assembles a self-loop.

```
* = $C000
a = *       ; a = $C000
jmp *       ; jmp $C000 (self-loop)
```

**Numbers:**

| Prefix   | Base        |
|----------|-------------|
| `$`      | Hexadecimal |
| `%`      | Binary      |
| `0`      | Octal       |
| `1`-`9`  | Decimal     |

**Expressions** support the full C precedence table:

| `.eq`, `.ne`                         | Equality, inequality                |
| `&`                                  | Bitwise AND                         |
| `^`                                  | Bitwise XOR                         |
| `\|`                                 | Bitwise OR                          |
| `&&`, `\|\|`                         | Logical AND, OR                     |
| `?`, `:`                             | Ternary conditional                 |

The ternary form is `condition ? true-expr : false-expr`.

| `.endmacro`             | End of macro definition                                      |
| `.local name`           | Macro-local label; expanded to a unique name at call time    |
| `.scope [name] [file="f"] [dest="d"]` | Open a scope namespace; anonymous if no name given. `name` may be a bare identifier or a quoted identifier (`"name"`). `file=`/`dest=` create a host-resolved output target |
| `.endscope`             | Close the innermost scope (and end any output redirect)     |
| `.proc name`            | Open a named procedure (a named scope)                       |

| `.segdef "n",addr[,flags]` | Define a named segment at `addr`. Flags (comma-separated) are any of `emit`/`noemit` (suppress output) and `locked` (pin the address; never auto-moved) |
| `.segdef "n",reclaim="host"` | Define a reclaim segment overlaying an emitted `host`: implicitly `noemit`, inherits the host's start, sized no larger than the host, and moves with it if auto-adjust relocates the host |
| `.segment "n"`          | Activate the named segment; `.segment ""` returns to native mode |
| `.6502`                 | Restrict to 6502 opcodes (default)                           |

| `.wdc`                  | Allow the Rockwell profile plus WDC WAI and STP              |

**Paths:** `.include` and `.incbin` resolve relative to the directory of the
**including** file first. If that miss fails, they try each directory on the search
list, using the include string as written (no basename strip). Search directories come
from:

1. Host / CLI seeds: `am65 -I <dir>` (repeatable; paths are relative to the process
   working directory), or the same API used by an emulator host
2. In-source `.search "dir"` (resolved relative to the file that contains it)

`-I` entries are applied first; `.search` appends after them. Duplicate resolved
directories are ignored. `.search` only affects `.include` / `.incbin` that appear
**after** it. Empty or missing search directories produce a warning.

```
.search "../shared"
.include "local.s"     ; beside this file if present
.include "shared.s"    ; else ../shared/shared.s
```

**`.byte` and strings:** `.byte` accepts strings as well as numeric expressions.
`.strcode` is not applied to string arguments of `.byte`.

### Macros

```
.macro name [arg [, arg]*]
    body
.endmacro
```

Arguments are substituted as text. Arguments that contain a comma must be wrapped in
double quotes: `"($55),y"`. Use `.local` inside a macro body to generate label names
that are unique per invocation.

```
.macro add_a_b a b
    clc
    lda a
    adc b
.endmacro

    add_a_b $12, $34
    add_a_b "($55),y", #12
```

### Scopes and Procs

`.proc` and `.scope` define namespaces that allow label reuse:

```
.proc loader
start:
    lda $D011
.endproc

.proc display
start:
    sta loader::start + 1    ; access a label in another scope
.endproc
```

Use `::` at the start of a name to resolve from the root scope. Labels in different
scopes do not collide.

A scope name may be written bare (`.scope game`) or quoted (`.scope "game"`); the two
forms are equivalent. Quoting is allowed for symmetry with `.segdef`, but because a
scope name is used in `::` qualified references (`game::start`), a quoted name must
still be a legal identifier -- it cannot contain spaces or other non-identifier
characters.

Anonymous scopes (`.scope` without a name) are useful inside
loops to prevent iteration labels from clashing:

```
.for i=0, i .lt 8, i++
  .scope
    addr = $D800 + i
  start:
    lda addr
  .endscope
.endfor
```

### Segments

Named segments let you lay out memory regions and switch between them:

```
.segdef "ZEROPAGE", $02, noemit
.segdef "CODE", $0810
.segdef "DATA", $C000

.segment "ZEROPAGE"
ptr:    .res 2

.segment "CODE"
main:
    lda (ptr),y
    ...

.segment "DATA"
table:  .byte $01,$02,$03
```

`noemit` segments advance the location counter but produce no output -- useful for
mapping zero-page variables without emitting placeholder bytes. A `noemit` segment
may not overlap any other segment; to overlay memory intentionally, use a reclaim
segment (below).

A **reclaim** segment piggybacks on an emitted "host" segment so a region can be
reused at runtime once the host's contents are consumed. The classic case is a title
image loaded as part of the executable and then relocated (say, under the KERNAL) as
the program starts, freeing its load area for buffers and variables:

```
.segdef "TITLE", $5000              ; the image, emitted into the program
.segdef "REUSE", reclaim="TITLE"    ; buffers that reuse TITLE's space at runtime

.segment "REUSE"
buffer: .res $100                    ; lives at $5000, emits nothing
```

A reclaim segment is implicitly `noemit`, takes no address of its own (its labels
resolve into the host's memory), and is sized no larger than its host. It follows the
host automatically: if auto-adjust moves the host, the reclaim segment moves with it.
The host must be a previously defined, emitted segment. Consuming or relocating the
host before the reclaimed region is used is the programmer's responsibility -- the
assembler enforces only the address and size relationship, not the runtime ordering.

Emitted segments are checked for overlap. Normally an overlap fails assembly and
prints a compacted set of suggested starts. With segment auto-adjust enabled, those
starts are applied temporarily and pass 1 is restarted up to three times. This
re-evaluates `.align` padding at each new start, so a first approximation that changes
segment sizes can converge on a later retry. The lowest segment remains the packing
anchor; subsequent emitted segments are packed contiguously in address order.

A `locked` segment is an anchor whose start address is never changed by auto-adjust --
use it for regions the hardware requires at a fixed address, such as a bitmap or
sprite data that VIC-II reads from a specific location. Lower segments are still
packed around a locked segment, but if they grow enough to overrun it, auto-adjust
does not attempt to reshuffle the layout around the anchor: assembly fails with an
error naming the locked segment, leaving the fix to the author.

```
.segdef "CODE",   $0810
.segdef "HIRES",  $2000, locked   ; VIC bitmap -- must stay at $2000
```

### Strcode

`.strcode e` remaps string characters using the expression `e`. The variable `_` holds
the current character's ASCII value:

```
.strcode _ .ge 'A' && _ .le 'Z' ? _ - 'A' : _ .ge 'a' && _ .le 'z' ? _ - 'a' : _
.string "Hello"
```

This remaps A-Z to 0-25 and a-z to 0-25, leaving other characters unchanged. Restore
default behavior with `.strcode _`. Quoted escape sequences (`\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\0`,
`\\`, `\xNN`, `\0NN` octal) are processed in strings but are not passed through
`.strcode`.

### Named Output Targets

A named `.scope` can send its output to a separate file, so a single source can build
several binaries in one pass -- a loader plus a game, a main program plus overlays, and
so on:

```
* = $0801
        ; ... loader code, written to the default output ...

.scope game file="game.bin"
    * = $C000
main:
        inc $D021
        jmp main
.endscope
```

Everything between the named `.scope file="..."` and its `.endscope` is assembled into
its own output image; code outside goes to the default output. Labels remain visible
across files through the normal scope rules (`game::main`), so the loader can reference
addresses in the game and vice versa. An optional `dest="..."` names the target for
tooling without binding it to a file name.

The assembler core passes `file=` and `dest=` to its host. Command-line `am65` uses
`file=` to create a separate binary and accepts but ignores `dest=`. A `dest=`-only
scope therefore continues writing into its parent file image.

The in-emulator C64 host ignores `file=` and accepts only `dest="map"`, which writes
to live C64 RAM. A file-only target also defaults to `map`. Destination matching is
case-insensitive; every other destination name is an assembly error.

### Build-Time Detection

The define `AM65` distinguishes how the source is being assembled: it is `1` under the
command-line `am65` tool and `0` when assembled by the in-emulator Assembler tab. The
emulator also predefines `C64=1`; standalone `am65` defines no machine symbol. Use
these to switch behaviour between a live-poke session and a file build:

```
.if AM65
    * = $0801           ; standalone build: normal load address
.else
    * = $C000           ; live in the emulator: assemble into spare RAM
.endif
```

Additional build flags can be injected from the command line with `-D name[=value]`
(see below) and tested the same way.

### Command-Line Assembler (am65)

`am65` is a standalone build of the same assembler, for use in scripts and makefiles.
It writes raw binary files rather than poking live memory.

```
am65 -i <infile> [-o <outfile>] [-a <addr>] [-s <symfile|->]
     [-C <6502|65c02|rockwell|wdc>] [-D name[=value]]...
     [-I <dir>]... [--auto-adjust-segments] [-v] [-h]
```

| Switch            | Effect                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-i <infile>`     | Assembly source to assemble (required)                            |
| `-o <outfile>`    | Binary output for the default (unnamed) target                    |
| `-a <addr>`       | Origin/load address of the default target (default `$0000`; accepts `$hex`, `0xhex`, or decimal). Not needed if the source sets its own origin with `* =` / `.org` |
| `-s <symfile\|->` | Write a symbol + segment listing; `-` sends it to stdout          |
| `-C`, `--cpu <name>` | Select the initial CPU profile (default `6502`)               |
| `-D name[=value]` | Predefine a text define (value defaults to `1`); repeatable       |
| `-I <dir>`        | Add an include/incbin search directory (cwd-relative); repeatable; same list as `.search`, tried before `.search` |
| `-A`, `--auto-adjust-segments` | Retry overlapping pass-1 layouts up to three times using suggested starts |
| `-v`              | Verbose: hex-dump each target's emitted bytes                     |
| `-h`              | Show usage                                                        |

Each output file contains exactly the range of addresses the source emitted into.
Named `.scope file="..."` targets are written to their own files (resolved relative to
the current directory). `dest=` is accepted but ignored. `AM65` is predefined to `1`;
no emulator machine symbol is predefined.

```
am65 -i alt/root.asm -I shared -o out.bin
am65 -i demo.asm -o loader.prg -a $0801 -D VERSION=3 -s symbols.txt
```

## Configure

The Configure dialog (opened from **[Configure...]** in **Misc -> Machine**) has three
tabs: **Machine**, **Emulator**, and **Paths**. Shared controls for the INI file sit
below the tab body on every tab.

### Machine

| Control           | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| Video             | Select `NTSC` or `PAL`; changes take effect on reboot |
| Keyboard Joystick | Select `Off`, `Port 1`, or `Port 2`, plus the `Numpad` or `WASD` key layout |
| Turbo Modes       | Comma-separated mode list, e.g. `1,max` (1=normal, 2/`max`=max; `3` rejected) |
| Pause on BRK      | Auto-pause free-run at the next `BRK` (`$00`) as a crash aid; off by default so carts that hit a KERNAL-handled BRK during boot (e.g. Ocean's Wonderboy) keep running; applies live |
| Emulate 1541      | Route disk I/O through the real 1541 DOS ROM (needs a 1541 ROM); applies live |
| 1541 media (GCR)  | When Emulate 1541 is on: GCR tracks, rotation, SYNC, motor/head; enables G64 |
| Show disk LEDs    | Draw green (read) and red (write) activity LEDs in the window corner |

The Keyboard Joystick port selector matches the runtime **Shift+Opt+1** /
**Shift+Opt+2** assignment; either place can change the active port. Change the layout
here or with **Shift+Opt+M**. Changing Video reboots the emulated machine while
preserving its running state. Emulate 1541, 1541 media (GCR), Show disk LEDs, and the
other Machine settings apply immediately when you press **[OK]** or **[Save INI now]**.

### Emulator

| Control           | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| Scroll Wheel Speed| Number of rows scrolled per wheel click (1-100) |
| Symbol Files      | Add symbol files and display the comma-separated list of selected files |
| True Aspect Ratio | Show the geometry a real TV showed, using the VIC-II pixel aspect ratio (PAL 0.9365, NTSC 0.7500); off stretches the picture to fill the view |
| CRT Smoothing     | Filter the picture instead of showing hard pixel edges; forced on by CRT Scanlines and CRT Curvature |
| CRT Scanlines     | Simulate the dark gap between raster lines; the slider sets strength from 1-100% |
| CRT Curvature     | Bend the picture toward a curved CRT surface; the slider sets amount from 1-100% |

The CRT controls are a live preview: checkboxes and sliders update the C64 display while
Configure remains open. **[Cancel]** or the dialog close button restores the values that
were active when Configure opened. **[OK]** accepts them. All three effects are optional
and independent; with them disabled, c64m uses the original rectangular render path.

### Paths

The Paths tab has a **ROMs** section followed by the default browse folders.

**ROMs** sets the ROM file paths (file endpoints, not folders). Each row has an edit box
showing the path relative to the INI file's directory and a **[...]** button that opens a
file picker:

| Field     | ROM                                                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| System    | Combined 16 KB system ROM (BASIC + KERNAL)                     |
| Kernal    | Separate 8 KB KERNAL ROM                                       |
| Basic     | Separate 8 KB BASIC ROM                                        |
| Character | 4 KB character ROM                                             |
| 1541      | 16 KB 1541 DOS ROM (optional; enables Emulate 1541)           |

The **Single Basic/Kernal ROM** checkbox chooses between the two supply modes. When
ticked, the combined **System** ROM is used and the **Kernal** and **Basic** fields are
disabled; when unticked, the separate **Kernal** and **Basic** ROMs are used and **System**
is disabled. **Character** and **1541** are always available. Changing any ROM path (or the
checkbox) reboots the emulated machine and reloads the ROM set when you press **[OK]**. ROM
paths are saved by **[OK]** and by **[Save Paths Only]**.

**Default browse paths** hold the folder the file browser remembers per browse type.
Each field starts empty (the browser then opens in the current working directory) and
updates as you pick files. Paths are shown and stored relative to the INI file's
directory, and each row has a **[...]** button that opens a folder picker:

| Field     | Used by                                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| assembler | Select Assembler Source                                        |
| disk      | Mount / Add Disk Image (drives 8 and 9 share this)             |
| program   | Load PRG/BAS, and Load/Save Binary with no Basic checkbox      |
| basic     | Load/Save Binary with **Basic Program** ticked                 |
| text      | Load/Save Binary with **Basic Text** ticked                    |
| snapshot  | Save/Load State - and the quicksave folder (Shift+Opt+> / <)   |

Edits to the browse folders take effect on the next browse immediately. The folder
picker's **[Use This Folder]** button selects the folder currently shown. **[Save Paths
Only]** rewrites just the ROM paths (and the Single Basic/Kernal ROM flag) and the browse
folders into the named INI file, leaving every other setting untouched; it is a silent
no-op if no INI file is set.

### INI File

Below the tab body, the Configure dialog shows the INI file path and a **[...]**
button. Changing the path prompts c64m to parse the selected file immediately.

**Auto-save INI on Quit** enables persistent save-on-quit behavior by writing `Save=yes`
under `[config]`. When that box is ticked, quitting the emulator writes the current
settings to the named INI file.

| Button            | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| **[Save INI now]**| Apply the dialog settings and write the INI file immediately (including the current window size and layout splitters); Configure stays open |
| **[OK]**          | Apply all changes without writing the INI (quit still saves when Auto-save is on) |
| **[Cancel]**      | Discard dialog changes |

## INI Files

c64m reads `c64m.ini` from the current directory by default. Use `--inifile <path>` to
load a different file, or `--noini` to skip loading entirely.

Relative paths in the INI (ROMs, disks, browse folders, assembler source, symbols) are
resolved against the directory that contains the INI file, not against the process
working directory. That means
`../c64m/build/c64m -i ../c64m/c64m.ini -p game.prg` from another project folder still
finds `roms/character.rom` next to the INI. Absolute paths stay absolute. On save, paths
near the INI (under it, or a close sibling via at most two `..` steps) are rewritten
relative so a movable install stays portable; farther absolute paths are kept absolute.

Command-line media paths (`--prg`, `--disk`, and similar) stay relative to the shell's
current directory.

The `[Video] standard` setting can be overridden for a single launch with `--video PAL`,
`--video NTSC`, `-P`, or `-N`.

All section names are case-insensitive. Comment lines start with `#`. Saving from the
emulator removes comments.

### [config]

| Key               | Value                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Save`            | `yes` -- save INI on quit                               |
| `scroll_wheel_lines` | Integer; lines scrolled per wheel click             |
| `log_level`       | `all`, `warn` (default), `error`, or `none`; host log policy (also `--log-level`). Does not mute CLI/usage errors on stderr. |
| `symbol_files`    | Comma-separated list of symbol file paths              |
| `turbo_speeds`    | Comma-separated turbo modes, e.g. `1,max` (1=normal, 2/`max`=max; `3` rejected) |
| `pause_on_brk`    | `true`/`false`; when true, free-run auto-pauses at the next `BRK` (`$00`). Absent/false (default) executes BRK like hardware so carts that hit a KERNAL-handled BRK during boot keep running |

### [Video]

| Key              | Value                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `standard`       | `PAL` or `NTSC` (default `NTSC`)                        |
| `true_aspect`    | `true`/`false`; true shows the real TV geometry, false fills the view |
| `crt_smoothing`  | `true`/`false`; filter the picture rather than show hard pixel edges |
| `crt_scanlines`  | `true`/`false`; enable scanlines                         |
| `crt_scanline_strength` | Integer 1-100; scanline darkness (default `35`) |
| `crt_curvature`  | `true`/`false`; enable curved-screen distortion          |
| `crt_curvature_amount` | Integer 1-100; curvature amount (default `30`)   |

### [input]

| Key                        | Value                                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `keyboard_joystick_layout` | `numpad` or `wasd` (default `numpad`)               |
| `keyboard_joystick_port`   | `0` (disabled), `1`, or `2` (default `0`)           |

The port can also be set for one launch with `--kbdjoy <0|1|2>`, and the layout with
`--kbdjoy-layout <numpad|wasd>`.

### [browse]

Default folders the file browser remembers per browse type (see the Configure
dialog's Paths tab). Any missing key defaults to the current working directory.

| Key         | Used by                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `assembler` | Select Assembler Source                                   |
| `disk`      | Mount / Add Disk Image (drives 8 and 9)                   |
| `program`   | Load PRG/BAS and Load/Save Binary with no Basic checkbox  |
| `basic`     | Load/Save Binary with Basic Program ticked                |
| `text`      | Load/Save Binary with Basic Text ticked                   |
| `snapshot`  | Save/Load State and the quicksave folder                  |

The legacy `[state] quicksave_folder` key is read once and migrated into
`[browse] snapshot` if the latter is absent, then removed the next time c64m saves
the INI (it no longer exists as a separate setting).

### [Window]

| Key      | Value                            |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| `width`  | Window width in pixels           |
| `height` | Window height in pixels          |

### [Layout]

| Key                    | Value                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `split_display_right`  | Float 0-1; vertical split between C64 and debugger |
| `split_top_bottom`     | Float 0-1; horizontal split between top and bottom |
| `split_memory_misc`    | Float 0-1; split between memory and misc panel     |

### [rom] or [roms]

| Key         | Value                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `basic`     | Path to BASIC ROM (8192 bytes)       |
| `kernal`    | Path to KERNAL ROM (8192 bytes)      |
| `char` or `character` | Path to character ROM (4096 bytes) |
| `system`    | Path to combined system ROM (16384 bytes) |
| `1541`      | Path to combined 1541 DOS ROM (16384 bytes) |
| `single_system` | `true`/`false`; when true the combined `system` ROM supplies BASIC and KERNAL, and `basic`/`kernal` are ignored; when false the separate `basic`+`kernal` ROMs are used and `system` is ignored |

If `single_system` is absent it is derived: a combined `system` ROM without a
`basic`+`kernal` pair defaults to true, otherwise false. These paths and the flag are
editable on the Configure dialog's Paths tab.

Relative ROM paths are resolved against the INI directory. If a path is missing or the
file does not open, c64m searches for files named `basic`, `kernal`, `character`,
`system`, and `1541` (with any extension) in:

1. `.`, `rom/`, `roms/` (current working directory)
2. the executable's directory, plus `rom/` and `roms/` under it
3. the executable's parent directory, plus `rom/` and `roms/` under it (so a binary in
   `build/` still finds project-root `roms/`)
4. the INI file's directory, plus `rom/` and `roms/` under it

### [disk]

Each key is the device number. The value is a comma-separated list of D64 image paths.
Paths may be absolute or relative to the directory containing the INI file.

| Key | Value                                                            |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `8` | D64/G64 image or comma-separated list of images for device 8    |
| `9` | D64/G64 image or comma-separated list of images for device 9    |
| `8_writable` | Parallel `0`/`1` list for device 8 images; omitted means read-only |
| `9_writable` | Parallel `0`/`1` list for device 9 images; omitted means read-only |
| `emulate_1541` | `true`/`false`; when true and a 1541 ROM is loaded, route disk LOADs through real IEC/1541 emulation |
| `media_1541` | `true`/`false`; when true with `emulate_1541`, use GCR media path (rotation/SYNC/head); needed for G64 |
| `show_disk_leds` | `true`/`false`; when true (default), show green read / red write activity LEDs in the window corner |

Example - single disk:

```
[disk]
8=./games/galencia.d64
```

Example - multi-disk queue for a multi-part game:

```
[disk]
8=./games/tron_1.d64,./games/tron_2.d64,./games/tron_3.d64
```

The first image in the list is mounted at startup. The current position within the queue
is not saved; launching the emulator always starts from the first image.

Example - writable scratch disk (D64 or G64):

```
[disk]
8=./disks/scratch.d64
8_writable=1
```

```
[disk]
emulate_1541=1
media_1541=1
8=./disks/blank.g64
8_writable=1
```

### [assembler]

Persists the Assembler tab state. All keys are optional; absent keys restore to their
defaults on next launch.

| Key              | Value                                               | Default |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `file`           | Path to the root source file, normally stored relative to the INI directory | -       |
| `address`        | Hex load/assembly origin, e.g. `8000`               | `8000`  |
| `use_address`    | `yes` / `no` - Apply `address` as host origin       | `yes`   |
| `run_address`    | Hex auto-run address, e.g. `8000`                   | `8000`  |
| `auto_run`       | `yes` / `no` - Jump to run address after assembling | `no`    |
| `reset`          | `yes` / `no` - Reset C64 before assembling          | `yes`   |
| `rearm_oneshots` | `yes` / `no` - Rearm one-shot breakpoints before assembling | `no` |
| `auto_adjust_segments` | `yes` / `no` - Retry overlap layouts with suggested starts | `no` |

### [DEBUG]

Breakpoints are stored as repeated `break` keys. Entries are not required to be unique
at the key level; a numeric suffix is added automatically when the emulator saves
multiple breakpoints.

Each entry has the form:

```
break.<suffix> = <address[-address]>[,access][,mapping][,actions][,count=N][,reset=N]
```

**Address and access:**

| Part              | Meaning                                           |

| `address`         | Hex address, e.g. `C000` or `$C000`              |
| `-address`        | Optional range end                                |
| `execute`         | Execute breakpoint                                |
| `read`            | Read-access breakpoint                            |
| `write`           | Write-access breakpoint                           |
| `access`          | Read or write                                     |
| `map` / `rom` / `ram` | Mapping filter                              |

**Actions:**

| Token              | Meaning                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `break`            | Pause execution                                                      |

| `tron=path`        | Enable execution trace; writes to `path`                             |
| `swap=+N`          | Advance device 8 disk queue forward N steps (wraps)                  |
| `swap=-N`          | Advance device 8 disk queue backward N steps (wraps)                 |
| `swap=N`           | Mount the Nth disk in the device 8 queue, 1-based (wraps)            |
| `swap` or `swap=0` | Swap action present but no-op                                        |
| `type=text`        | Inject text as C64 keystrokes; text uses the input-encoding format (see **Type text format** under **Breakpoints**) |
| `count=N`          | Fire on the Nth hit                                                  |
| `reset=N`          | Repeat interval after firing; `1` = every hit (default), `N>1` = every Nth hit, `0` = auto-disable after firing |

Examples:
```
break.C000 = execute,map,break
break.D000-D3FF = write,map,fast
break.C100 = execute,map,break,count=10,reset=2
break.E000 = execute,map,tron=my_trace.log
break.C000.1 = execute,map,swap=+1
break.E38B = execute,map,type=load\x22*\x22\x2c8\x2c1\[RT]
```

## Keyboard

Keys listed here are intercepted by the emulator before reaching the C64. On macOS,
**Opt** = Option/Alt.

(**Shift+Opt+Ins**) supports named keys, PETSCII escapes, matrix addresses, and joystick
events in addition to literal text; see **Type text format** under **Breakpoints**.

### C64 Key Mapping

The host keyboard maps semantically to C64 keys. Common mappings:

| Host Key           | C64 Key                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|

| `]` or `Shift+*`   | *                                      |

All ASCII printable characters are mapped where possible. Characters with no C64
equivalent are silently ignored during paste.

## Remote

c64m has an opt-in localhost TCP control port for remote debugging and automation. It is
disabled by default. Start it with:

```sh
./c64m --control-port 6510
```

For automation without a visible window or host audio device, use headless mode:

```sh
./c64m --headless --control-port 6510
```

To restore a machine snapshot as soon as the process starts (before remote commands),
combine headless mode with `--sna`:

```sh
./c64m --headless --control-port 6510 --sna demos/midload.c64state
```

The server always binds to `127.0.0.1`. It accepts one client at a time. The socket
thread performs network I/O only; runtime commands and snapshot requests are dispatched
by the main loop, so remote control follows the same thread-ownership rules as the GUI
debugger. The current protocol name is `C64M/8`.

Unsolicited events may arrive with request id `0`, for example
`0 event state-changed reason=step session=2 cycles=... frame=... epoch=...`. Scripts that
match replies by id must skip or queue these lines (the bundled Python `Ctl` client
does). History FIND/NEXT cursors are per asker session; a mutation from any asker
invalidates active cursors (`CURSOR_STALE` -> re-FIND).

### Quick Start

A remote session is line-oriented. Each request starts with a decimal request id, then a
command, then command arguments:

```text
1 ping
2 pause
3 get-cpu
4 get-memory $0400 64 map
5 set-memory $0400 4 ram
<4 raw bytes>
6 quit-client
```

Responses begin with the same id:

```text
1 ok
2 ok accepted=1
3 ok pc=FD84 a=00 x=00 y=2F sp=FD p=25 cycles=1712136
4 data memory 64 addr=0400 length=64 mode=0
<64 raw bytes>
5 ok addr=0400 length=4 mode=1
6 ok
```

`quit-client` closes the TCP client connection. It does not quit the emulator process.
Headless automation should terminate the process externally after the final client
command.

### Request Format

Requests are ASCII lines terminated by `\n`:

```text
<id> <command> [arguments...]\n
```

`<id>` is a decimal unsigned integer chosen by the client. c64m does not require ids to
be sequential, but sequential ids make logs easier to read. Commands are lower-case
words with hyphens. Hex addresses may be written as `0xC000` or `$C000`; decimal counts
and timeouts are written without a prefix.

Most commands are single-line. A few commands carry a length-prefixed raw payload after
the request line (same framing as the paste-data commands):

```text
<id> paste-text-data <byte_count>\n
<byte_count raw bytes>\n

<id> paste-events-data <byte_count>\n
<byte_count raw bytes>\n

<id> set-memory <addr> <length> <map|ram>\n
<length raw bytes>\n
```

The payload may contain arbitrary bytes except that the framing still requires exactly
one trailing newline after the payload. Paste payloads are limited to 4096 bytes;
`set-memory` payloads are limited to 1..1024 bytes. `get-memory` allows 1..65536
bytes in one call (see **State and Snapshots**).

### Response Format

Text responses are ASCII lines terminated by `\n`:

```text
<id> ok [metadata...]\n
<id> error <code> <message>\n
```

Binary responses use a header line, exactly `<byte_count>` raw payload bytes, and one
trailing newline:

```text
<id> data <type> <byte_count> [metadata...]\n
<byte_count raw bytes>
\n
```

The client should parse the byte count from the `data` header and then read exactly that
many bytes before consuming the trailing newline. Do not treat binary payloads as
newline-delimited text.

Deferred responses use a multi-entry table (capacity 16). **Token-matched**
commands such as `get-cpu` and `get-memory` may be outstanding together. Other
deferred work (waits, breakpoints, assemble, ...) is still exclusive. A second
conflicting deferred command may return:

```text
<id> error busy deferred-response-active
<id> error busy wait already active
<id> error busy deferred-table-full
```

Clients may **pipeline** requests (send several without waiting) up to the
outstanding high-water mark; responses may complete out of send order - correlate
by request id. Duplicate outstanding ids are rejected with `bad-id`.

Deferred commands time out with:

```text
<id> error timeout deferred response timed out
```

Headless mode wakes the main loop when a control request is queued (not only on a
fixed 1 ms sleep). Prefer headless for low-latency automation; a windowed session
is still paced by present/vsync (~16 ms class).

### Connection and Introspection

| Command | Response |
|---------|----------|
| `hello` | `ok name=c64m protocol=C64M/8` |
| `version` | `ok protocol=C64M/8 app=c64m` |
| `capabilities` | Space-separated capability names |
| `ping` | `ok` |
| `quit-client` | `ok`, then the server closes the client connection |

`capabilities` currently includes (among others) `connection`, `introspection`,
`execution`, `state`, `step`, `turbo`, `frame`, `memory`, `debug-memory`, `call-stack`,
`input`, `disk`, `file`, `snapshot`, `breakpoints`, `wait`, `assemble`, `symbols`,
`drive-cpu`, `vic`, `cia`, `run-to-raster`, `history`, `frame-ring`, `vic-ring`,
`sessions`, and `state-changed`. The `snapshot` token means machine save/load
(`.c64state`) via `load-state` / `save-state`. The `state` token means runtime
inspection (`get-state`), not file snapshots. `sessions` / `state-changed` mean
per-asker history cursors and unsolicited mutation informs (open mutation; no lock).

### Execution Control

Execution commands return after the command is accepted by the runtime, not after the
machine reaches a new state. Use `wait-*` commands when a script needs to synchronize.

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `reset` | Reset the emulated machine |
| `run` | Resume execution |
| `pause` | Pause execution |
| `step-cycle` | Execute one machine cycle |
| `step-instruction` | Execute one CPU instruction |
| `step-over` | Step over a JSR |
| `step-out` | Run until the current subroutine returns |
| `step-frame` | Advance one VIC-II frame, publish it, and pause |
| `run-to-raster <line> [cycle]` | Run until VIC raster line (optional cycle-in-line), then pause |
| `run-cycles <count>` | Run for a positive cycle count |
| `run-instructions <count>` | Run for a positive instruction count |
| `run-to <addr>` | Run until the PC reaches a 16-bit address |
| `set-turbo <1\|2\|max>` | Set turbo mode: 1=normal, 2/`max`=max (`3` rejected) |

Accepted execution commands respond:

```text
<id> ok accepted=1
```

`set-turbo` changes only the active mode; it does not modify the configured Opt+T
turbo list. `set-turbo 2` or `set-turbo max` pauses the CPU flight recorder when
`history_off_on_max` is on (default) and wipes Inspector Record when
`inspector_off_on_max` is on (default). Returning to turbo 1 resumes HST1 and
restores Record into an empty window. The accepted response includes the
requested mode:

```text
<id> ok accepted=1 turbo=2
```

### CPU Flight Recorder

The flight recorder continuously retains recent main-CPU execution and physical
bus accesses in a bounded memory arena. The default budget is 256 MiB. Set it
with `--history-memory=<MiB>` or `[debug] history_memory_mb`; `0` disables the
feature and other valid values are 16 through 4096.

In the debugger UI, **Forensics** (**Opt+R**) is the interactive FIND surface
over this recorder (see **Forensics**). The control-port verbs below are the
same engine for scripts. Inspector Record does not arm or stop this recorder.

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `history-info` | Report availability, recording state, epoch, timelines, retained IDs, records, and bytes |
| `history-record <on\|off>` | Resume or stop recording without discarding retained records |
| `history-clear` | Clear retained records and start a new epoch |
| `history-find [key=value ...]` | Search retained execution and markers |
| `history-next <cursor> [limit=1..256]` | Continue the current search |
| `history-read <id> [epoch=N] [before=0..256] [after=0..256]` | Read one record with surrounding context |
| `history-close <cursor>` | Close a cursor; closing an absent cursor is harmless |

Find, next, and read require the machine to be paused. Searches run newest-first
unless `direction=forward` is specified. Find accepts these keys:

```text
epoch timeline cycle from direction pc address access value opcodes limit
```

Ranges are inclusive. `from` is `oldest`, `newest`, or a retained record ID.
Access values are `execute`, `opcode`, `operand`, `data-read`, `data-write`,
`dummy-read`, `rmw-dummy-write`, `stack-read`, `stack-write`, or `vector-read`.
Aliases are `fetch`, `read`, `write`, and `data`. Opcode patterns contain 1..32
comma-separated bytes and may use `?` nibble wildcards, for example
`A9,??,8D`.

Find, next, and read return a counted binary `data history` response with
metadata:

```text
epoch=N count=N cursor=N more=0|1 oldest=N newest=N
```

The payload is little-endian HST1: a 24-byte header followed by records with a
48-byte header and 8-byte bus-access entries. Use
`tools/c64_control_client.py` to validate and decode it. There is one search
cursor; execution, reset, recording control, state load, or direct machine
mutation makes it stale. Searches use a 10 second timeout; other deferred
commands use the standard 2 second timeout.

### Frame Ring

The flight recorder retains what the CPU did; the frame ring retains what the
screen showed. It keeps the most recent completed frames in memory so a glitch
that lasted a single frame can still be retrieved after you notice it and pause,
which is typically a second and about fifty frames later.

The default budget is 128 MiB, roughly 206 PAL frames or four seconds at 50 fps.
Set it with `[debug] frame_ring_memory_mb`; `0` disables the ring and other valid
values are 8 through 4096.

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `frame-ring-info` | Report capacity, retained count, dropped frames, recording state, and the retained frame and cycle range |
| `frame-ring-record <on\|off>` | Resume or stop recording without discarding retained frames |
| `frame-ring-clear` | Discard retained frames |
| `get-frame-at <frame=N\|cycle=N> [format=argb8888\|indexed8]` | Fetch one retained frame |

The target must be named as either a frame number or a machine cycle, because a
bare number could be either and the wrong reading returns a plausible but wrong
frame. The lookup resolves to the nearest frame at or before the target. A target
past the newest returns the newest; a target older than the retained window
returns `not-found` rather than a substituted neighbour. Payloads are identical
to `get-frame` in the same format.

These commands answer immediately and work while the machine runs, although the
retained window keeps moving until you pause. Turbo max keeps live paint, so the
ring keeps recording; breakpoint FAST (paint off) stalls the ring. Loading a
machine state clears the ring.

Each retained frame carries its machine cycle, which is the key for searching the
flight recorder for the same moment.

### VIC Ring

The frame ring shows that a frame is wrong; the VIC ring shows why. It retains
the VIC-II state at the end of each raster line, including the sprite X position
(with its high bit from $D010) that was actually latched for painting that line.
That latched value need not match what the sprite registers hold afterwards, and
a sprite that appears at the wrong edge for a single frame is exactly that
disagreement. Neither the frame ring nor the flight recorder can show it.

The default budget is 16 MiB, roughly 161000 lines or 500 PAL frames. Set it with
`[debug] vic_ring_memory_mb`; `0` disables the ring and other valid values are 1
through 1024.

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `vic-ring-info` | Report capacity, retained lines, dropped lines, recording state, and the retained frame, raster, and cycle range |
| `vic-ring-record <on\|off>` | Resume or stop storing lines |
| `vic-ring-clear` | Discard retained lines |
| `vic-ring-find [frame=N] [raster=L or F-L] [limit=1..2048]` | Fetch matching lines as text records |

Every key is optional. Omitting the frame matches the raster window in every
retained frame, which is how a per-line effect is compared across frames. Records
are returned oldest first, one text line per raster line, and each carries the
machine cycle that ties it to the frame ring and the flight recorder.

This records far more often than the frame ring, once per raster line rather than
once per frame, and costs about 2.6 percent of maximum free-run speed. Real-time
speed is unaffected. Turning recording off stops storing lines but does not
recover that cost, because the record is still built each line. To recover it,
disable the ring with a budget of `0`.

### State and Snapshots

| Command | Response |
|---------|----------|
| `get-state` | Text state summary: runtime state, CPU availability, frame, cycle, stop reason, turbo; when hardware is known also `raster=` and `vic_cycle=` |
| `get-cpu` | Text CPU snapshot |
| `get-vic` | Text VIC-II internal state (raster, cycle, compare latch, VC/RC, IRQ, BA/AEC/RDY, ...) |
| `get-cia <1\|2>` | Text CIA internal state including ICR mask |
| `get-frame [format=argb8888\|indexed8]` | Binary frame snapshot |
| `get-memory <addr> <length> <mode>` | Binary memory snapshot |
| `set-memory <addr> <length> <map\|ram>` | Poke bytes (paste-style raw payload; auto-pauses) |
| `get-debug-memory [write-history=0\|1]` | Fresh binary debugger memory snapshot (map+ram+rom) |
| `get-call-stack` | Text call-stack summary |
| `step-frame` | Advance one full VIC-II frame, publish it, and pause |

`get-state` is answered from the main loop's cached frontend debug state.
`get-frame` uses the latest completed frame cached by the main loop, or requests one
if no cached frame exists yet. In headless mode the main loop still polls frame
snapshots for `get-frame` and `wait-frame`.

When the machine is **paused** and no mutating command has been accepted since the
last machine snapshot, `get-cpu`, `get-vic`, and `get-cia` may be answered from the
main-thread hot cache (no runtime round-trip). Mutating commands mark that cache
stale. While running, or after a mutation without a barrier, those commands still
go through deferred runtime work. `get-memory`, `set-memory`, `get-debug-memory`,
`get-call-stack`, and flight-recorder commands are deferred when they need the
runtime.

`step-frame` is the preferred way to capture consecutive frames: it runs until the
next completed VIC-II frame is published, then pauses. It honors breakpoints and BRK.
Prefer it over free-run `wait-frame` loops when you need every frame without aliasing.
`run-to-raster` stops on a VIC beam line (and optional cycle); breakpoints and BRK
still win if they fire first.

Memory modes:

| Mode | `get-memory` | `set-memory` | Meaning |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| `map` | yes | yes | CPU-visible memory after current banking |
| `ram` | yes | yes | Physical RAM |
| `rom` | yes | **no** | Physical ROM where available, RAM elsewhere |
| `drive8` | yes | **no** | Drive 8 CPU map (holes possible) |
| `drive9` | yes | **no** | Drive 9 CPU map (holes possible) |

`get-memory` length is **1..65536**, with `address + length <= 65536` (reject
wrap). A full 16-bit dump is one call: `get-memory $0000 65536 <mode>`. It returns
a binary `data memory` response whose payload is exactly the requested bytes
(no write-history on this path; use `get-debug-memory` for history):

```text
<id> data memory <byte_count> addr=<hex> length=<n> mode=<0..4>
<n raw bytes>
```

`set-memory` is the poke counterpart of `get-memory`. Wire form:

```text
<id> set-memory <addr> <length 1..1024> <map|ram>\n
<length raw bytes>\n
```

`set-memory` length remains **1..1024**. Only **writable** modes `map` and `ram`
are accepted; `rom`, `drive8`, and `drive9` are rejected with `error bad-args`.
The command **auto-pauses** (like `assemble`) so the poke lands while the machine
is stopped; the runtime also force-pauses if it was still running. Completion is
deferred until the write finishes:

```text
<id> ok addr=0400 length=4 mode=1
```

`mode` in the response is the same numeric encoding as `get-memory` (`0` = map,
`1` = ram).

Example: write four bytes at `$0400` in RAM, then read them back:

```text
1 set-memory $0400 4 ram
<4 raw payload bytes>
2 get-memory $0400 4 ram
```

Typical responses:

```text
1 ok addr=0400 length=4 mode=1
2 data memory 4 addr=0400 length=4 mode=1
<4 raw bytes>
```

Default frame format is ARGB8888. The buffer is a full VIC-II raster line (PAL
504x312, NTSC 520x263) in VIC-X order with no frontend crop. Metadata:

```text
<id> data frame <bytes> width=<504|520> height=<312|263> stride=2080 format=argb8888 frame=<n> cycle=<cycle>
```

`<bytes>` is `height * stride`. **`stride` is always 2080** (520 px x 4) for ARGB;
index rows by `stride`, never by `width`.

`format=indexed8` returns one palette index (0..15) per pixel, with `stride=width`
and payload size `height * width` (about 157 KB for PAL). Prefer indexed frames when
comparing against VICE, which uses different RGB values for the same indices.

`get-debug-memory` always refreshes from the runtime (it does not serve a stale
cache). Payload order:

```text
map bytes, then ram bytes, then rom bytes
```

Without write history the payload is `196608` bytes. With `write-history=1`, an
additional write-history payload is included; the header metadata records
`generation=` and whether write history is present.

`get-vic` exposes the raster **compare latch** (what line the VIC is armed for) and
other internal state not recoverable from `$D0xx` alone. `get-cia` exposes the
interrupt mask that real hardware cannot read back.

### Waiting

Wait commands are deferred responses checked by the main loop after normal runtime
polling. They never block SDL rendering or event processing.

| Command | Completes when |
|---------|----------------|
| `wait-paused [timeout_ms]` | Runtime state is paused (stop reason is current) |
| `wait-running [timeout_ms]` | Runtime state is running |
| `wait-frame <frame_delta> [timeout_ms]` | The frame counter advances by at least `frame_delta` |
| `wait-event <event_name> [timeout_ms]` | A named runtime event is observed |

The default timeout is 2000 ms. Explicit timeouts must be 1..600000 ms.

Useful event names include `running`, `paused`, `reset-complete`, `step-complete`,
`run-complete`, `frame`, `breakpoints`, `disk-status`, `call-stack`, `debug-memory`,
`assemble-complete`, `assemble-error`, `load-state-complete`, `save-state-complete`,
`disk-swap`, `started`, `stopped`, and `error`.

Completion events (`load-state-complete`, `save-state-complete`, `reset-complete`,
`assemble-complete`, `assemble-error`, `step-complete`, `run-complete`) are **sticky**:
if the event fires before `wait-event` is registered, the wait still completes. A
successful wait reports `event=<name> seq=<n>`. Continuous events such as `frame` are
not sticky.

Example synchronization (frame-accurate capture while paused):

```text
1 reset
2 wait-paused 2000
3 step-frame
4 wait-event run-complete 5000
5 get-frame format=indexed8
6 step-frame
7 wait-event run-complete 5000
8 get-frame format=indexed8
```

Example free-run then pause:

```text
1 reset
2 run
3 wait-running 2000
4 wait-frame 10 5000
5 get-frame
6 pause
7 wait-paused 2000
8 get-state
```

Example machine-snapshot load:

```text
1 load-state demos/midload.c64state
2 wait-event load-state-complete 10000
3 get-state
4 get-cpu
5 get-vic
```

### Input and Paste

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `key-down <key>` | Press a C64 key |
| `key-up <key>` | Release a C64 key |
| `restore` | Trigger RESTORE/NMI |
| `joystick <port> <mask>` | Set joystick state for port 1 or 2 |
| `paste-text <text>` | Paste literal text using timed C64 keystrokes |
| `paste-events <text>` | Parse and paste input-encoding events |
| `paste-text-data <byte_count>` | Payload form of `paste-text` |
| `paste-events-data <byte_count>` | Payload form of `paste-events` |

Key names are lower-case C64 key names: `a` through `z`, `0` through `9`, `space`,
`return`, `delete`, `left-shift`, `right-shift`, `plus`, `minus`, `asterisk`, `equals`,
`colon`, `semicolon`, `comma`, `period`, `slash`, `at`, `cursor-right`, `cursor-down`,
`home`, `run-stop`, `control`, `commodore`, `left-arrow`, `up-arrow`, `pound`, `f1`,
`f3`, `f5`, and `f7`.

Joystick masks use the C64 joystick bit layout:

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | `1` | Up |
| 1 | `2` | Down |
| 2 | `4` | Left |
| 3 | `8` | Right |
| 4 | `16` | Fire |

For parser-based paste, use the same input-encoding format as the Type breakpoint
action.

### Files and Disks

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `load-prg <path>` | Load a PRG file using the file's two-byte load address |
| `load-bin <path> <addr> <use_file_addr> <reset_first> <is_basic>` | Load a binary file with explicit flags |
| `save-bin <path> <start> <end> <write_file_addr> <is_basic>` | Save a host file from memory |
| `load-state <path>` | Load a machine snapshot (`.c64state`) |
| `save-state <path>` | Save a machine snapshot (`.c64state`) |
| `mount-d64 <device> <path>` | Mount a D64 on device 8 or 9 |
| `unmount-disk <device>` | Unmount device 8 or 9 |
| `get-disk-status <device>` | Return mounted/status information |

Boolean flags accept `0`, `1`, `false`, or `true`. Paths may contain spaces. For
`load-prg`, `load-state`, `save-state`, and `mount-d64`, the path is the rest of the
line after the fixed arguments. For `load-bin` and `save-bin`, the parser treats the
final fixed address/boolean arguments as command arguments and everything before them
as the path. `save-bin` and `save-state` can overwrite host files, so use them with the
same care as any other local file-writing command.

`load-prg`, `load-bin`, `save-bin`, `load-state`, `save-state`, and disk commands return
`ok accepted=1` when the runtime accepts the request, not when the file operation
finishes. Follow with `wait-event` (for example `load-state-complete` or
`save-state-complete`) or later state queries. A failed snapshot load leaves the live
machine unchanged.

### Breakpoints

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `break-exec <addr>` | Create an enabled execute breakpoint with the default break action |
| `break-list` | Request the breakpoint list |
| `get-breakpoints` | Alias for `break-list` |
| `break-clear <id>` | Clear one breakpoint |
| `break-clear-all` | Clear all breakpoints |
| `break-enable <id> <enabled>` | Enable or disable one breakpoint |
| `break-create <definition>` | Create a breakpoint from an explicit definition |
| `break-update <id> <definition>` | Replace an existing breakpoint definition |
| `rearm-oneshots` | Rearm one-shot breakpoints |

Definition syntax:

```text
<access> <addr> [enabled=0|1] [end=<addr>] [actions=<list>] [counter=N] [reset=N] [mapping=map|rom|ram]
```

`<access>` is `exec` / `execute`, `read` / `load`, `write` / `store`, or
`read-write` / `load-store`. Use `end=` for an inclusive address range (for example
`write $D000 end=$D02E`).

`actions` is a comma-separated list of `break`, `fast`, `slow`, `tron`, `troff`,
`type`, and `swap`, or the exclusive token `none` for a **count-only** breakpoint
that never pauses. After a free run, read `hits=` from `break-list`.

Examples:

```text
break-create write $D012 actions=break
break-create exec $EA31 actions=none
break-create read $0400 end=$07E7 mapping=ram actions=break
```

Breakpoint list responses are binary-framed `data breakpoints` responses whose payload
is newline-separated ASCII text:

```text
<id> data breakpoints <byte_count> count=<count>
id=1 enabled=1 start=C000 end=C000 has_end=0 access=1 mapping=0 actions=1 use_counter=0 hits=0 initial=0 reset=1 counter=0
```

`access` is a bit mask: **1 = execute, 2 = read, 4 = write**. VICE checkpoint op masks
use the reverse assignment (`load=1, store=2, exec=4`) - do not copy numeric masks
from VICE scripts. The payload is text even though it uses `data` framing, so clients
should still honor the byte count. If a breakpoint definition is rejected by the
runtime, the control port returns `error runtime <message>` rather than hanging.

### Assembler and Symbols

The control port can assemble a source file into the running machine and look up the
labels that result. This drives the same assembler and settings as the Misc -> Assembler
tab, so a script can build code, find where a routine landed, and set a breakpoint on it.

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `assemble [address=<hex>] [run-address=<hex>] [auto-run=0\|1] [reset=0\|1] <source-path>` | Assemble a source file into the machine |
| `find-symbol <name>` | Resolve a label from the most recent assembly |

The optional `key=value` settings precede the source path and may appear in any order.
Any token that is not a recognized option begins the source path, which runs to the end
of the line and may contain spaces. The settings mirror the Assembler tab, and their
defaults are the same:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `address` | `$8000` | Host default origin; source may re-anchor with `* =` / `.org` before any bytes are emitted |
| `run-address` | same as `address` | PC used when `auto-run` is on |
| `auto-run` | `0` | Run the assembled code after a successful build |
| `reset` | `1` | Reset the machine and return to BASIC before assembling |

Before assembling, the control port pauses the machine so the result lands in a defined
state. The assembler's own reset and auto-run handling then applies: a `reset=1` assemble
resets, runs to BASIC, assembles, and resumes; `auto-run=1` sets the PC to `run-address`
and resumes. As in the Assembler tab, a host `address=` is only a default until the
source emits bytes or sets its own origin.

`assemble` is a deferred (asynchronous) command. On success the reply carries the
assembly address:

```text
1 assemble reset=0 address=$c000 samples/c64/test1.asm
1 ok address=$C000
```

On failure the reply is an error whose message is the assembler diagnostic:

```text
2 assemble reset=0 badsource.asm
2 error assemble-error File: badsource.asm L:00001 C:012: Unexpected token after expression
```

A successful assembly publishes the resolved symbol table. `find-symbol` resolves a label
from that table by exact name:

```text
3 find-symbol loop
3 ok address=$C004 name=loop
```

If the name is not present the reply is `error not-found`. If no assembly (or symbol file)
has published symbols yet, the reply is `error not-ready`. Symbols are also published when
a symbol file is loaded, and in the GUI a successful remote assembly refreshes the
debugger's Disasm and Symbol Lookup views just as the Assembler tab does.

A typical automation sequence assembles, locates a routine, breakpoints it, and runs:

```text
1 assemble address=$c000 samples/c64/test1.asm
2 find-symbol loop
3 break-exec $C004
4 run
5 wait-paused 5000
```

### Example Python Client

This small client sends a command and handles both text and binary responses:

```python
import socket

def read_line(sock):
    data = b""
    while not data.endswith(b"\n"):
        chunk = sock.recv(1)
        if not chunk:
            raise EOFError("connection closed")
        data += chunk
    return data.decode("ascii").rstrip("\n")

def send(sock, line):
    sock.sendall((line + "\n").encode("ascii"))
    header = read_line(sock)
    parts = header.split()
    payload = b""
    if len(parts) >= 4 and parts[1] == "data":
        byte_count = int(parts[3])
        while len(payload) < byte_count:
            payload += sock.recv(byte_count - len(payload))
        if sock.recv(1) != b"\n":
            raise RuntimeError("bad data terminator")
    return header, payload

with socket.create_connection(("127.0.0.1", 6510)) as s:
    print(send(s, "1 ping")[0])
    print(send(s, "2 pause")[0])
    print(send(s, "3 get-cpu")[0])
    header, frame = send(s, "4 get-frame")
    print(header, len(frame))
    print(send(s, "5 quit-client")[0])
```

## Details

This section records implementation details that are not necessary for day-to-day use
but are useful for understanding what the emulator actually does under the hood.

### Architecture

c64m uses a layered C99 architecture: Machine -> Runtime -> Frontend, with a shared Tools
layer. The machine (CPU, VIC-II, CIA, SID, bus, and drives) runs entirely on a dedicated
runtime thread. The UI and renderer run on the main thread. No live machine pointers
cross threads -- all inter-thread data travels as copied snapshots through a
command/event queue. The snapshot rule is strictly enforced: the frontend may only read
runtime-provided copies and must never access live machine state directly.

The machine owns a monotonic master cycle counter. VIC-II, CIA, and SID hooks receive
timestamped CPU bus events and advance their own state to the exact event cycle before
applying visible side effects.

### CPU

The MOS 6510 core is instruction-compatible with the 6502. Timed bus events classify
each memory access (read or write) and timestamp it within the opcode so that
mid-instruction side effects (CIA ICR reads, SID writes, VIC register writes with
raster-timed effects) land at the correct cycle. IRQ is level-sensitive; NMI uses an
edge-triggered latch so a single NMI edge triggers exactly once even if the NMI line
stays asserted. RESTORE routes through the NMI path.

The machine has a resumable Phi2 execution path covering the full documented 151-opcode
NMOS set, the practical undocumented families (SLO, RLA, SRE, RRA, DCP, ISC/ISB, LAX,
SAX), and the stable undocumented NOPs. Those instructions issue one typed CPU bus access
per completed Phi2 cycle. The chip-dependent unstable forms (such as LAX #imm) fall back
to the compatibility execute-and-replay path; all 256 opcode slots have explicit dispatch.

BA stall: when VIC-II asserts BA, the CPU is held on read-like cycles while a write may
still complete, as on hardware. The emulator classifies opcode fetches, operand reads,
data reads, dummy reads, RMW dummy writes, stack accesses, vector reads, and data writes
separately. AEC and RDY are separate VIC-II pin state exposed at cycle granularity: RDY
stalls reads, and AEC blocks CPU bus access during an actual VIC takeover. Analog and
half-cycle AEC/RDY behavior is not modeled. This is a progressively more accurate bus
model, not yet a claim of complete cycle-perfect 6510 behavior.

### Memory and Bus

The full 64 K address space is backed by RAM. BASIC ROM ($A000-$BFFF), KERNAL ROM
($E000-$FFFF), and character ROM ($D000-$DFFF) are mapped in or out by the CPU I/O port
at $0001 (LORAM, HIRAM, CHAREN bits). I/O ($D000-$DFFF) takes priority over character
ROM when CHAREN is set.

Character ROM is also visible through the VIC-II bus in VIC banks 0 and 2 at the
corresponding 4 K ranges. VIC bank selection uses CIA #2 Port A bits PA0/PA1 with
inverted mapping (four 16 K banks).

Debugger-safe read functions (`c64_debug_read_cpu_map`, `c64_debug_read_ram`,
`c64_debug_read_rom`) let the UI inspect memory without triggering CIA ICR
clear-on-read, TOD latching, or other bus side effects. The memory and disassembly views
use these safe reads exclusively.

The memory view's `1541 Map 8` and `1541 Map 9` modes use the same rule for the drive:
drive RAM, ROM, and VIA registers are copied through side-effect-safe debug reads. Reading
the memory view does not acknowledge VIA interrupt flags or otherwise act like a live
drive CPU bus read. Unmapped drive addresses are marked unavailable rather than treated
as writable C64 memory.

For debugging writes, the machine also keeps a 64 K write-history table, one 64-bit value
per C64 address. Normal CPU opcode writes update the addressed entry by shifting the old
value left 16 bits and appending the opcode PC in the low 16 bits. This retains the last
four instruction PCs that wrote to the address. Loader injection, debugger pokes, reset
initialization, and other non-opcode writes are not recorded in the first version of the
feature.

### VIC-II

Pixels are emitted cycle-by-cycle as VIC-II time advances. Mid-frame register changes
(color, scroll, mode bits) take effect at their exact event cycle rather than at frame
start. The internal frame is 384x312 (PAL, full raster) or 384x263 (NTSC). The displayed
crop is per-standard and never reaches past the frame the VIC-II actually painted: PAL
shows 352x248 from frame row 28 (rows 28..275), NTSC shows 352x224 from row 39 (rows
39..262). Both keep the 200-line display area plus overscan above and below. The display
window is rows 51..250 on both standards, so NTSC has only 12 border lines below it
against PAL's 25 - which is why its crop is shorter, and why a PAL-sized 248-row crop
would run past NTSC's last raster and show unpainted fill.

**Graphics modes:** standard text (40x25), multicolor text, standard bitmap, multicolor
bitmap, ECM (extended color), and invalid modes 5/6/7 (black background and display
layer). XSCROLL and YSCROLL are applied as delayed display-window edges. RSEL/CSEL
control 25/24-row and 40/38-column window clamps. DEN=0 blanks the graphics layer to the
background color ($D021), but the vertical border flip-flop never opens, so the border
covers the whole screen: what you actually see is $D020 everywhere, not $D021. This is
visible during KERNAL boot, before CINT sets DEN.

**Sprites:** all 8 hardware sprites with 9-bit X position (MSB register), per-sprite
enable, hires (24x21) and multicolor (12x21 logical pixels) modes, X-expand and
Y-expand with correct flip-flop behavior, front/behind-foreground priority ($D01B),
sprite-sprite and sprite-background collision latches ($D01E/$D01F) with read-clear and
write-ignore, and IRQs (IMMC/IMBC) wired through the VIC IRQ path. Sprite pointer
(p-access) and data (s-access) fetches are bank-aware.

The bus scheduler distinguishes Phi1 idle/graphics/sprite-pointer work from Phi2 bad-line
character and sprite-data work, and BA is derived from those scheduled Phi2 accesses
rather than from a separate BA-assert table. A single look-ahead over the schedule gives
the sprite 3/4 cross-line windows for free. Sprite fetch cycles come from tested per-
standard tables (PAL and NTSC), and sprite X wrapping follows the line length - 504 dots
PAL, 520 NTSC - rather than a fixed 512.

The VIC-II also exposes scheduled c-access and sprite-fetch markers for machine-level
timing traces. Idle g-access remains an approximation, light pen ($D013/$D014) is
stubbed, and last-byte-on-bus behavior is not modeled.

**Registers:** full mirroring at $D000-$D3FF; unused high-bit masking per hardware spec;
open-bus high nibble on color register reads returns 1; unused block $D02F-$D03F reads
as $FF.

**VIC-II IRQ sources:** raster compare (programmable line), sprite-sprite collision, and
sprite-background collision; the light pen source is not implemented. IRQ status ($D019)
and enable ($D01A) with aggregate enabled-pending bit 7. All three sources edge-trigger:
raster compare fires on non-match to match, and the collision sources fire only when
$D01E/$D01F go from zero to non-zero, so acknowledging $D019 while a collision latch is
still set does not re-fire it.

### CIA

**CIA #1** drives keyboard and joystick input and generates IRQs via timer underflow.
Timers A and B are 16-bit down-counters with separate latch and live counter, continuous
and one-shot modes, Phi2/CNT/cascade source selection, PB6/PB7 output in pulse and
toggle modes, and ICR flag/mask management with clear-on-read. The keyboard matrix scan
supports bidirectional Port A/Port B scanning and multi-key simultaneous press with
correct active-low combining. Joystick port 1 reads from Port B bits 0-4; port 2 from
Port A bits 0-4. Keyboard and joystick inputs share CIA lines with correct combining.

**CIA #2** provides VIC bank selection (Port A PA0/PA1, inverted), IEC ATN/CLK/DATA
open-collector line modeling, and NMI via timer underflow. The NMI output uses an edge
latch to avoid repeated NMI assertions while the line stays asserted.

**Time-of-Day (TOD):** BCD tenths, seconds, minutes, hours in 12-hour AM/PM format with
correct 11->12 and 12->1 rollover. Source frequency (50/60 Hz) is selected per CRA bit 7.
Reading hours latches all TOD fields; reading tenths releases the latch. The alarm fires
via ICR bit 2 and routes through the normal IRQ/NMI mask logic. Debugger peeks read TOD
without creating or releasing the CPU-visible latch.

### SID

The MOS 6581 register map covers $D400-$D41F. Three voices each have a 24-bit phase
accumulator, four waveforms (triangle, sawtooth, pulse with 12-bit width, noise via a
23-bit LFSR), TEST bit, hard sync and ring modulation against the preceding voice, ADSR
envelope with a fractional double accumulator and clock-parameterized rate tables (PAL and
NTSC constants selected at `sid_init`), and gate control. Voice 3 oscillator (phase bits
23-16) and envelope are readable at $D41B/$D41C. Paddle reads ($D419/$D41A) return $FF.

The mixer scales each voice by its envelope, divides by 3 for headroom, and applies the
master volume ($D418 bits 0-3). Voice 3 can be disconnected from the mix via $D418 bit 7.
$D417 bits 0-2 route voices 1-3 through the filter; unrouted voices bypass it and are
mixed back in after mode selection.

The Chamberlin state-variable filter runs once per cycle, with cutoff from $D415/$D416
through a LUT and resonance from $D417 bits 4-7. Filter mode is selected by $D418 bits
4-6 (LP/BP/HP); no mode bits bypass the filter entirely. Filter states are clamped to
[-2, +2].

Audio reaches the host via a lock-free SPSC ring buffer. A fractional cycle accumulator
converts PAL (985248 Hz) or NTSC (1022727 Hz) machine cycles to the host sample rate
(48 kHz). Turbo mode skips audio writes to prevent buffer flooding while SID state
continues to advance. The SDL audio callback reads from the ring buffer on a separate
thread; it never calls runtime or machine code.

**SID deferred:** exact 6581 combined-waveform analog blending (a deterministic
approximation is used), runtime 8580 switching, and paddle input beyond the
not-connected policy. The model is not bit-perfect analog 6581.

### Disk

Device 8 and device 9 each hold an independent D64 or G64 image, read-only by default
and optionally marked writable. In the default
compatibility mode, the KERNAL LOAD trap intercepts $FFD5 for devices 8/9 only; all
other devices fall through to ROM. `LOAD "NAME",8` loads at the BASIC start pointer and
updates end-of-program pointers. `LOAD "NAME",8,1` loads at the embedded PRG load
address. `LOAD "$",8` synthesises a tokenized BASIC directory listing with the disk
title, file list, and blocks-free line. Filename matching supports exact names, `*`
prefix wildcard, `?` single-character wildcard, and bare `*` for the first PRG. The
parser validates chain links and guards against sector loops and out-of-range
references.

When `[disk] emulate_1541=1` is set and a combined 16 K 1541 DOS ROM is loaded through
`[roms] 1541`, the trap is disabled for devices 8/9 and KERNAL LOAD proceeds over the
emulated IEC bus. The 1541 model runs the drive 6502, two VIA 6522s, the standard DOS
2.6 ROM serial handlers, ATN/CLK/DATA open-collector signaling, and ATN acknowledge.

Without `media_1541`, disk-controller mechanics are abstracted: ROM READ/SEARCH jobs
are satisfied from the mounted D64 image (job intercept) rather than a rotating GCR
stream. Writes use the same job-dispatch path. The DOS command channel (scratch, rename,
validate, initialize, FORMT-job-intercepted format) and `OPEN 15,8,15` work through the
real ROM.

With `[disk] media_1541=1` as well, the emulator synthesises GCR tracks from D64 (or
attaches G64 track dumps), models motor/stepper/SYNC/BYTE READY, and lets stock DOS
physical READ run against the flux path. D64 WRITE/FORMT still use a hybrid job
intercept plus GCR track poke/rebuild. Writable G64 uses physical Port-A flux
write-back (live track ring exported to the host image on leave-write, seek-off-dirty,
unmount, and media disable); G64 mounts stay read-only unless marked writable. Stock
BASIC SAVE/LOAD on a writable blank G64 is supported; empty-track grow/format rebuild
and broad pure-write fidelity are not claimed. Multi-stage commercial loaders are not
broadly claimed.

When the 1541 ROM is absent, D64 SAVE falls back to the compatibility KERNAL trap
(G64 has no trap path). Cross-drive copy, block/memory-execute edge cases, and devices
beyond 8/9 remain out of scope.

### Joystick

Port 1 is emulated via CIA #1 Port B bits 0-4. Port 2 via CIA #1 Port A bits 0-4. A
connected gamepad defaults to port 2; Opt+1 and Opt+2 reassign it.

The host keyboard can also act as a joystick. It is disabled by default; assign it to a
port with **Shift+Opt+1** / **Shift+Opt+2**, the Keyboard Joystick control in the
Configure dialog, or `--kbdjoy`. A gamepad and the keyboard may share the same port,
in which case their directions and fire are combined.

When a `.c64state` snapshot is saved, host extras are stored with it and restored on
load: the active keyboard joystick port and layout, and the disk path queues for
devices 8 and 9 (including which image is selected in each queue).

Two layouts are available:

| Layout   | Directions             | Diagonals            | Fire   |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| `numpad` | Keypad 8 / 2 / 4 / 6   | Keypad 7 / 9 / 1 / 3 | Keypad 0 |
| `wasd`   | W / S / A / D          | (hold two keys)      | Space  |

The numpad keys are not C64 keys, so the `numpad` layout never interferes with typing.
The `wasd` keys are C64 keys, so while the keyboard joystick is assigned to a port they
drive the joystick instead of reaching the C64. They type normally when the keyboard
joystick is disabled or when a debugger view has keyboard focus. The `numpad` layout
uses keypad key codes, so Num Lock must be on. The port and layout are saved in the
`[input]` INI section.

### Display and Scaling

The C64 display is scaled to fit its panel. The display settings are under
**Misc -> Machine -> Configure -> Emulator**, and all of them preview live, with Cancel
restoring their previous values.

The `CRT` prefix marks the difference between them. **CRT Smoothing**, **CRT Scanlines**
and **CRT Curvature** are deliberate imitations of a CRT: they add artifacts that were never
in the C64's signal, for looks. **True Aspect Ratio** carries no prefix because it is not an
imitation of anything - it is the real geometry of the signal, which a CRT had no part in
producing.

**CRT Smoothing** filters the picture instead of drawing hard-edged pixels, which rounds
and softens characters the way a real tube did. It is the cheapest of the three: it is only
a texture filter, with no per-frame processing at all.

CRT Scanlines and CRT Curvature both force CRT Smoothing on, and show it ticked and greyed
out while they are enabled. They are drawn through a filtered texture and cannot be
presented without it, so crisp pixels plus scanlines is not an available combination.

**True Aspect Ratio** decides the shape of the picture:

- **On** - the picture keeps the geometry a real TV showed, using the VIC-II pixel
  aspect ratio (PAL 0.9365, NTSC 0.7500). C64 pixels are taller than they are wide,
  far more so on NTSC, so PAL lands near 4:3 (~1.33) while NTSC is visibly narrower
  (~1.18). Letterbox or pillarbox fills the unused space (black).
- **Off** - no correction at all: the picture stretches to fill the view, whatever
  shape you have made it, and there are no bars. How you want to look at your C64 is
  your call.

In Debug Mode, clicking the corner handle at the bottom-right of the display region
without dragging snaps the region to the true aspect (see **Layout**), so the correct
geometry is one click away in either mode.
